so sweet and everything she says makes sensegreat.professor nirusha explains all the concepts very clearly. the peer instructions allow us to apply what we have learnedand they are very helpful.it was a great course and i look forward to be taught by prof. nirusha again!very goodvery goodthe labs were hard for many people generally the experimental portion was muvh harder.the course itself is amazing, the information presented is wonderful for those who have had a background in chemistry.i would just like to say that maybe there should be an introductory course (similar to bioa11) for those who would like tolearn more about chemistry but do not have the necessary background in order to exceldr.thavarah was an amazing chemistry professor, who truly cares about her students. her peer instructions wererevolutionary, in the sense that they engaged critical thinking within the classroom\xcd\xbe something not commonly done byother university professors. he taught at a steady pace, which allowed for students to understand the course material.professor nirusha was a very good instructor, she explained all concepts very clearly and she was very patient withanswering all questions. she genuinely wanted all her students to do very well in the course.amazing,it was excellent. couldn't have asked for a better first year chemistry course. i love the interactive learning and nirushais a very knowledgable and helpful instructor.it was good except the quizzes during practical was pretty confusing.the prof explained new concepts and had plenty of practice questions that helped strengthen the knowledge of theseconcepts. the teaching style did not cater to all types of people but the prof did a great job at clarifying confusingmaterial.pretty goods, evaluations were very fair, lectures were very engaginglecture really taught very well.nirusha explains everything very clearly. she is a very knowledgeable professor, and is easy to approach to. sheteaches in steady pace to make sure everyone understands the concept, and gives lots of examples and makes thelectures engaging.everything was explained in deep detail which better prepared us for the exam.did an amazing job teaching the content in class with a great mix of practice problems and lecturing.the content was well presented however the method in which she presented the knowledge was unclear and causedmass confusion, at times.i think the content was easy to understand however the midterm did display some difficulty as it the classes did notfocus much on the questions asked on the evaluation.well organized, the instructor knows the material well and explains it clearly.very interesting and very well taughtat the beginning the course was great however, towards the end the material was not clearly explained.pretty clear, labs were fun and informativen/athe professor did an excellent job covering the course materialprofessor thavarajah was excellent at giving lectures, she motivated me to learn, and is excellent at explaining coursematerial. however, sometimes the lab material could be a little bit confusing\xcd\xbe specifically discerning what we weretasked with in the report sheets.the course was challenging for me at times, however as someone who is not particularly interested in chemistry, i didquite well and found some material interesting.introductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/4/20174/17   commentsit was okthis course provided a good understanding of the material required. the lectures aligned nicely with the textbook'scontent, allowing the student to clearly understand the concepts.she is the best at taking itme to eplain concepts and knows when to slow down for students to catch upthe quality of instruction for labs were very poor, many of the quizzes and report sheets were not clear in what it wasasking for, therefore many were not doing good in the lab component of this course.it was a pretty difficult course for me, but i learned a lot from it so the headaches were worth it.i enjoyed the option of being able to watch the lectures online and in\xe2\x80\x93person. also, the peer instruction segmentsencourage to keep up with the course material and clarify some misunderstandings that i might've had beforehand.the instructions in this course were little unclear but overall okayi enjoyed this course in that there were many concepts that were intriguing and the instructor truly enjoyed the contentshe was teaching. his helped to engage me in the course along with the peer instructionsthe course was okprofessor nirusha is excellent. the peer class assessment portions of her lectures allowed me to become deeplyengaged in the course content while providing me a greater understanding of the subject material. the lecture contentwas informative and highly engaging.dr. thavarajah is a knowledgeable and able instructor. however, the flow of the course is really quite slow, which provedvery frustrating to me.professor thavarajah is very helpful and is always eager to help. she has helped me a great deal with how to managemy time and with a lot of the course content. she is an amazing professor.i absolutely love chemistry and i feel that professor thavarajah elevates the subject to a whole new level. she ispassionate about the topics taught in class, she takes the time to go through examples and explain how one dissects aproblem and answers it using the principles of chemistry being taught in class, and she cares about our learning whichis why she does peer instruction questions. she is knowledgeable about the material and creates a warm, welcoming,and happy learning environment for every student in this course. she is probably the most human of all the professorsi've had so far as she is not condescending, nor egotistical. instead, she teaches with passion and humility and love forthe subject of chemistry\xcd\xbe which is a great reflection on the students as it makes us want to do the same.the labs (practicals) were unrelated to the material being taught in the lecture around the 2\xe2\x80\x93week period of the labstaking place.the course was interesting however, the lab pre\xe2\x80\x93quizzes were worth too much as it was worth almost the same as thelab report. the peer instructions provided discussion and interactive learning throughout.very straightforward and engaging. the opportunities provided in class to practice the material helped a lot incementing the concepts learned.this course was good i liked doing examples in class which helped my in understanding the concepts togetheri loved the profthe classes really got us involved and labs sometimes being hard but were a great learning experience.labs are very low quality in terms of engagement and relevance to the ongoing lecture materialdr thavarajah is patient and helpful. her efforts do not go unnoticed as she encourages students to excel in classthis course was really well taught! i really found mastering chemistry assignments and the peer instructions (in thelectures) helped me better understand the content as we are applying what we know to the question we are solving. forthis course i truly found my self learning and expanding my knowledge! :di found difficulty understanding some of the material and felt new concepts were not explained thoroughly.i found that the instructor was good at explaining conceptsthis course was great because it developed my understanding of chemistrythe instruction was done by only 1 professor which was helpful as the method of teaching didn't change throughout thesemester, also the questions during classes test my basic abilities and allow me to fill in gaps that i may have missed.this course is great because of professor thavarajah. she provides excellent instruction, making the lecturesinteractive and stimulating and also challenges the class.the lecture portion of this course is fine, professor thavarajah explains the concepts clearly. the instruction on the labintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/4/20175/17   commentscomponent is rather clear from the lab manual, however, it was rather overwhelming for first year students, with theamount of tasks required to complete in 1 lab session.honestly, i do not think professor thavarajah could do a better job at teaching. she really covers all topics in lecturesand is always willing to help. she is very encouraging and you can tell that she truly wants her students to succeed.overall, good course, and good instructors.she is patient but somehow with too many peer exercise.i was able to learn a lot. peer instructions and sample problems were really insightful and put a lot of concepts togetherto help me understand.good in class application of knowledge, sometimes confusing even after explination, unsure on what equations wouldbe necessarythis professor is amazing! i never understood chemistry as well as i do right now!dr. thavarajah was extremely concerned with my learning, looking for every opportunity to make the content beunderstood easier, she explains concepts very well, but not so difficult that it would give me a hard time to understand.she goes very fast during the lectures, and sometimes i find it hard to keep up so i don't go in class anymore but theamount she puts in the lectures are fair and her tests are nothing we've never seen before.i love ow she gives sample questions and peer instructions that are not all easy!very clear at teaching, great teachingdr thavarajah went at a good pace. i liked how she always explained everything thoroughly.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good. i liked how the professor gave in class examples thatshe would take up.i didn't find the lectures necessary to attend as they didn't really help my learning.clear and good.the lectures were paced a little too slowly in my opinion, but this provided an opportunity for extensive reading and agreat understanding of the content.lectures gave a great understanding of the course.the instructor is patient and knowledgeable, so even though the class material is somewhat hard i still manage tograsp it.the professor always takes the time to explain concepts thoroughly, even if no one asked about it, a good thing sincemany students are afraid to ask for helpexcellent teaching with patience. explains things clearly and is enthusiatic all the time. she is amazingdr nirusha taught extremely well. however i feel as if the lab quizzes are a bit too hard, they should go easy on the labsas it should be more learning and hands on then focusing on just the quiz which is a great portion of your mark.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was good.material was well paced, instructor was organized and clear. while the practice questions in\xe2\x80\x93class are useful, a fewless may allow for material to be more spread out/more material covered instead of waiting to take up solutions to allthe problems.instructions were always clear & concise, never afraid to answer questions that students hadi loved the way nirusha taught the course and explained information during lectures.professor thavarajah is a very patient and understanding professor. i think that the way she explained answers and theway to get answers to a question were simple so that every student could understand the concepts applied during thequestion. the midterm was very fair as well, as i was able to understand all the questions and the mistakes i madewere due to lack of studying on my part. also, the peer instruction questions were super helpful in order to help meunderstand the concepts and how to apply them. their difficulty allowed me to really think questions through andpractice good test taking skills.the professor explains each topic thoroughly.goodhard to keep up with all the materialvery good!introductory chemistry

light. i can now better understand the concepts especially withher peer instructions questions.it was really really good. i enjoyed chemistryi did not take the grade 12 in chemistry in high school. this is why this course is somewhat challenging for mecomparing to the other students. there is however very big engagement of our professor in both lectures and officehours, we can go and meet her with every problem. fsg sessions are also very important part of this course. there is alot of practice what is also very helpful in studying.she explained topic thoroughly and gave a lot of examples but sometimes went through topics very quickly so i wouldsometimes get lostit was greatvery clearit was a good course, we went through the material at a fair pace and all concepts were well covered and lots of time ofpractice questions in class, which really helped me see the application of equations and conceptsi loved the peer instruction questions. they are extremely helpful and allows me to understand the course content to adeeper degree.each topic discussed during lectures were taught in a good manner. i was able to comprehend a majority of thematerial through lectures alone. this is completed/enhanced by the assignments on masteringchemistryi love nirusha she makes me love chem!our professor went through the material at very comfortable pace and thoroughly discussed it. i feel like this coursegave me a higher understanding of the topics i learned in high school.the instruction in the course was excellent as the professor as well as the tas were amazing in guiding the

instructions allow us to apply what we have learnedand they are very helpful . it was a great course and i look forward to be taught by prof . nirusha again ! very goodvery goodthe labs were hard for many people generally the experimental portion was muvh harder . the course itself is amazing , the information presented is wonderful for those who have had a background in chemistry . i would just like to say that maybe there should be an introductory course ( similar to bioa11 ) for those who would like tolearn more about chemistry but do not necessary background in order to exceldr . thavarah was an amazing chemistry professor , who truly cares about her students . her peer instructions wererevolutionary , in the xsense that they engaged critical thinking within the classroom\xcd\xbe something not commonly done byother university professors . he taught at a steady pace , which allowed for students to understand the course material . professor nirusha was a very good instructor , she explained all concepts very clearly and she was very patient withanswering all questions . she genuinely wanted all her students to do very xwell in the course . amazing , t was excellent . could not asked for a better first year chemistry course . i love the interactive learning and nirushais a very knowledgable and helpful instructor . it was good except the quizzes during practical was pretty confusing . the prof explained new concepts and had plenty of practice questions that helped strengthen the knowledge of theseconcepts . the teaching style did not cater to all types of people but the prof did a great job at clarifying confusingmaterial . pretty goods , evaluations were very fair , lectures were very engaginglecture really taught very well . nirusha explains everything very clearly . she is a very knowledgeable professor , and is easy to approach to . sheteaches in steady pace to make sure everyone understands the concept , and gives lots of examples and makes thelectures engaging . everything was explained in deep detail which better prepared us for the exam . did an amazing job teaching the content in class with a great mix of practice problems and lecturing . the content was well presented however the method in which she presented the knowledge was unclear and causedmass confusion , at times . i think the content was easy to understand however the midterm did display some difficulty as it the classes did notfocus much on the questions asked on the evaluation . well organized , the instructor knows the material well and explains it clearly . very interesting and very well taughtat the beginning the course was great however , towards the end the material was not clearly explained . pretty clear , labs were fun and informativen/athe professor did an excellent job covering the course materialprofessor thavarajah was excellent at giving lectures , she motivated me to learn , and is excellent at explaining coursematerial . however , sometimes the lab material could be a xlittle bit confusing\xcd\xbe specifically discerning what we weretasked with in the report sheets . the course was challenging for me at times , however as someone who is not particularly interested in chemistry , i didquite well and found some material interesting . introductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/4/20174/17 commentsit was okay this course provided a good understanding of the material required . the lectures aligned nicely with the textbook ' scontent , allowing the student to clearly understand the concepts . she is the best at taking itme to eplain concepts and knows when to slow down for students to catch upthe quality of instruction for labs were very poor , many of the quizzes and report sheets were not clear in what it wasasking for , therefore many were not good in the lab component of this course . it was a pretty difficult course for me , but i learned a lot from it so the headaches were worth it . i enjoyed the option of being able to watch the lectures online and in\xe2\x80\x93person . also , the peer instruction segmentsencourage to keep up with the course material and clarify some misunderstandings that i might have had beforehand . the instructions in this course were (little) not unclear but overall okay ayi enjoyed this course in that there were many concepts that were intriguing and the instructor truly enjoyed the contentshe was teaching . his helped to engage me in the course along with the peer instructionsthe course was okay professor nirusha is excellent . the peer class assessment portions of her lectures allowed me to become deeplyengaged in the course content while providing me a greater understanding of the subject material . the lecture contentwas informative and highly engaging . dr . thavarajah is a knowledgeable and able instructor . however , the flow of the course is really quite slow , which provedvery frustrating to me . professor thavarajah is very helpful and is always eager to help . she has helped me a xgreat deal with how to managemy time and with a lot of the course content . she is an amazing professor . i absolutely love chemistry and i feel that professor thavarajah elevates the subject to a whole new level . she ispassionate about the topics taught in class , she takes the time to go through examples and explain how one dissects aproblem and answers it using the principles of chemistry being taught in class , and she cares about our learning whichis why she does peer instruction questions . she is knowledgeable about the material and creates a warm , welcoming , nd happy learning environment for every student in this course . she is probably the most human of all the professorsi have had so far as she is not condescending , (nor) not egotistical . instead , she teaches with passion and humility and love forthe subject of chemistry\xcd\xbe which is a great reflection on the students as it makes us want to do the same . the labs ( practicals ) were unrelated to the material being taught in the lecture around the 2\xe2\x80\x93week period of the labstaking place . the course was interesting however , the lab pre\xe2\x80\x93quizzes were worth too xmuch as it was worth almost the same as thelab report . the peer instructions provided discussion and interactive learning throughout . very straightforward and engaging . the opportunities provided in class to practice the material helped a lot incementing the concepts learned . this course was good i liked doing examples in class which helped my in understanding the concepts togetheri loved the profthe classes really got us involved and labs sometimes being hard but were a great learning experience . labs are very low quality in terms of engagement and relevance to the ongoing lecture materialdr thavarajah is patient and helpful . her efforts do not unnoticed as she encourages students to excel in classthis course was really well taught ! i really found mastering chemistry assignments and the peer instructions ( in thelectures ) helped me better understand the content as we are applying what we know to the question we are solving . forthis course i truly found my self learning and expanding my knowledge ! : di found difficulty understanding some of the material and felt new concepts were not explained thoroughly . i found that the instructor was good at explaining conceptsthis course was great because it developed my understanding of chemistrythe instruction was done by only 1 professor which was helpful as the method of teaching did not change throughout thesemester , also the questions during classes test my basic abilities and allow me to fill in gaps that i may have missed . this course is great because of professor thavarajah . she provides excellent instruction , making the lecturesinteractive and stimulating and also challenges the class . the lecture portion of this course is fine , professor thavarajah explains the concepts clearly . the instruction on the labintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/4/20175/17 commentscomponent is rather clear from the lab manual , however , it was rather overwhelming for first year students , with theamount of tasks required to complete in 1 lab session . honestly , i do not think professor thavarajah could do a better job at teaching . she really covers all topics in lecturesand is always willing to help . she is very encouraging and you can tell that she truly wants her students to succeed . overall , good course , and good instructors . she is patient but somehow with too xmany peer exercise . i was able to learn a lot . peer instructions and sample problems were really insightful and put a lot of concepts togetherto help me understand . good in class application of knowledge , sometimes confusing even after explination , unsure on what equations wouldbe necessarythis professor is amazing ! i (never) not understood chemistry as xwell as i do right now ! dr . thavarajah was extremely concerned with my learning , looking for every opportunity to make the content beunderstood easier , she explains concepts very xwell but not difficult that it would give me a hard time to understand . she goes very fast during the lectures , and sometimes i find it hard to keep up so i do not in class anymore but theamount she puts in the lectures are fair and her tests are (nothing) not we have (never) not seen before . i love ow she gives sample questions and peer instructions that are not easy ! very clear at teaching , great teachingdr thavarajah went at a good pace . i liked how she always explained everything thoroughly . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good . i liked how the professor gave in class examples thatshe would take up . i did not find the lectures necessary to attend as they did not help my learning . clear and good . the lectures were paced a xlittle too xslowly in my opinion , but this provided an opportunity for extensive reading and agreat understanding of the content . lectures gave a great understanding of the course . the instructor is patient and knowledgeable , so even though the class material is somewhat hard i still manage tograsp it . the professor always takes the time to explain concepts thoroughly , even if (no_one) not asked about it , a good thing sincemany students are afraid to ask for helpexcellent teaching with patience . explains things clearly and is enthusiatic all the time . she is amazingdr nirusha taught extremely well . however i feel as if the lab quizzes are a bit too xhard , they should go easy on the labsas it should be more learning and hands on then focusing on just the quiz which is a great portion of your mark . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was good . material was well paced , instructor was organized and clear . while the practice questions in\xe2\x80\x93class are useful , a fewless may allow for material to be more spread out/more material covered instead of waiting to take up solutions to allthe problems . instructions were always clear & concise , (never) not afraid to answer questions that students hadi loved the way nirusha taught the course and explained information during lectures . professor thavarajah is a very patient and understanding professor . i think that the way she explained answers and theway to get answers to a question were simple so that every student could understand the concepts applied during thequestion . the midterm was very fair as xwell as i was able to understand all the questions and the mistakes i madewere due to lack xof xstudying on my part . also , the peer instruction questions were super helpful in order to help meunderstand the concepts and how to apply them . their difficulty allowed me to really think questions through andpractice good test taking skills . the professor explains each topic thoroughly . goodhard to keep up with all the materialvery good ! introductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/4/20176/17 commentsthe professor for this course is absolutely inspirational and makes me love to learn . dr . nirusha has allowed me to see chemistry in a new light . i can now better understand the concepts especially withher peer instructions questions . it was really really good . i enjoyed chemistryi did not grade 12 in chemistry in high school . this is why this course is somewhat challenging for mecomparing to the other students . there is however very big engagement of our professor in both lectures and officehours , we can go and meet her with every problem . fsg sessions are also very important part of this course . there is alot of practice what is also very helpful in studying . she explained topic thoroughly and gave a lot of examples but sometimes went through topics very quickly so i wouldsometimes get lostit was greatvery clearit was a good course , we went through the material at a fair pace and all concepts were well covered and lots of time ofpractice questions in class , which really helped me see the application of equations and conceptsi loved the peer instruction questions . they are extremely helpful and allows me to understand the course content to adeeper degree . each topic discussed during lectures were taught in a good manner . i was able to comprehend a majority of thematerial through lectures alone . this is completed/enhanced by the assignments on masteringchemistryi love nirusha she makes me love chem ! our professor went through the material at very comfortable pace and thoroughly discussed it . i feel xlike this coursegave me a higher understanding of the topics i learned in high school . the instruction in the course was excellent as the professor as xwell as the tas were amazing in guiding the studentsand helping them learn and understand the concepts as xwell as lab material . it was okay ay . amazing teacher . really inspires you with her knowledge and instills confidence in each and every one of her students . the course was taught wellthe instructors were very good with the instructions and getting all the material across8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your

assistance available support learn thiscourse,"b""i like the practice questions that the professor gives us. i think there should be a tutorial or something to help out withlab reports.fair quality, some topics could've been better explainedokayshe was really nice and inviting. it made me want to come back to the lectures just to see what i could learn .the professor clearly explained the materials in a pace where everything can be understood, making it easier tounderstand the coursedid a great job at explaining concepts and making sure everyone or majority of the class understood before proceedingto the next lecture/lessons. always attempted to clear up any confusion or unclear matter about the content.the peer instruction was always really helpful and the extra assignments allowed me to better understand the material.people really love to talk in this class which was distracting a lot, so maybe just say something to people like thatinstead of speaking over them.very engaging and the professor explained concepts and theories so well i was able to understand them even thoughin high school i had difficulty understanding them. it just shows how great instructions help me understand things.i love nirusha. she is such an amazing teacher! i wish i had her as my teacher for all 4 years. her way of teaching isexcellent... she's very patient, motherly and comforting. her lectures are very entertaining and i'm so grateful to have heras our instructor for chma10 only if she was my teacher next sem too :(lab section was not the best, unfairly marked (for me at least). lectures were okay. not the best i've had but that couldjust be my general disinterest in the field. mastering chem was a useful learning tool.instruction was very good. professor t. was always very helpful and clear.great.the quality of the instruction of this course was really good and provided with all the skills necessary to succeed inchemistry b\xe2\x80\x93courses.the overall quality of this course was good but the content was a week after the first week labs which was hard sincethe content from my lab was taught after my lab was overgoodalthough professors voice was too soothing, and it put me to sleepi love professor nirusha's lectures. the way she teaches the content makes it very understandable for meshe has all the criteria for being a perfect instructor. she tries to make students understand concepts unlike otherinstructors. peer instruction was incredibly productive for enhancing my understanding of chem. hope see prof.thavarajah in the upcoming courses.lectures were quite good, dr. thavarajah explains things very clearly and has lots of examples to show how to apply theteachings. dr. thavarajah clearly cares about learning (peer instruction, tons of optional online questions) so that thestudents fully understand the concepts. much of the labs are repeats of previous high school labs, which is nice to easeinto doing labs again, but i would have liked to see some labs that were a bit different.best professor. instruction was great.after the mid\xe2\x80\x93term, i have gotten very lazy with this course. the encouragement to study was not there and i would notcare a lot of what the instructor had to say.the materials covered in class were well defined and deeply elaborated.the prof was amazing. she made sure that students understood the material!very helpful and very kind. she cares about her students.\xe2\x80\x93lectures were informative and peer instruction allowed students to effectively apply skillsthe overall quality of the instruction of this course was very clear and easy to understood as the instructor were informus what is due and what are the important concepts in each chapter.it was clear what the wanted and they helped us to understand chemistry better by creating an interactive environmentduring lectures.12/4/20174/19   commentslectures were littered with examples that helped to iron out my understanding of details and intricacies required toachieve satisfaction.no complaints. lectures moved a bit fast, note taking was hardthe processor was very clear and easy understand. she made the course material easier to understand even though itwas difficult.ms.thavarajah clearly explains concepts and questions and show a clear concern for the wellbeing of her students.goodit was very enjoyable, and was able to learn most in this subject.professor explained topics effectively in lectures. the peer instructions were also great, as they allowed me tounderstand the topic more.excellentthe explanations and calculations were very thorough.i was so grateful to have professor nirusha thavarajah as my professor this semester. extremely knowledgable in hersubject but also a great educator that truly cares about your progress and understanding of the material. i hope to beable to have her again as a professor!!the overall quality of the instruction in this course is outstanding. professor thavarajah is an great professor. she goteveryone in the class involved and she really knows what she is talking about. she has done an excellent job gettingthe lessons through to everyone.professor went at a pace of understanding, took time to help with student difficulties, very clear on what we need toknow and takes concepts outside to real world problems. provided an atmosphere of learning, engaging with others.took time to help those who seemed assisance and genuinely concerned with student success. helped ensure thatstudents were not intimidated by content and that ensured students felt comfortable with content as a group.very good!the prof was amazing at explaining the key concepts of all units and really wanted us to understand everything beforemoving oni honestly don't like chemistry at all but the instructor is very good and friendly making the experience more tolerable.lectures contained content that was explained clearly and allowed students to think and complete practice questions.the instruction in this course was of high quality since professor thavarajah took time during the lecture to go throughthe questions step by step which allowed me to solidify my understanding of the conceptsvery good instructor. she explains everything clearly and helps out when you have questions. i like the peer instruction.excellent and very interactiveit is great to have a professor who is very organized and provides many opportunities to practice the concepts taught.the professor was highly knowledgeable in every field covered and explained things very clearly and easily. the coursedifficulty was average and the labs were very helpful in reinforcing concepts.goodthe in\xe2\x80\x93class lectures were incredible learning experiences. in using peer instruction as well as encouragingparticipation, dr. t was able to help me to better understand the course and related material. i felt extremely preparedfor my exams in this course and i have dr. t to thank for that. dr. t really cared about our learning and understanding ofthe course materials.our professor is amazing, she explains the material very clearly. answers all of our questions and is always there tohelp.nirusha is the greatest. prof of the f**kin year. legit, her peer instructions, learning environment, theengagement, the way she breaks concepts down and ensures that she does her best to make sure every studentunderstands it, oh man great prof. honestly, nirusha is a gem to utsc. i was extremely surprised to even know suchan amazing prof exists. the fact that everything she teaches sticks to my head when i get home is amazing. lovely,warm and welcoming prof. aside from that, a great representation of how teaching should be done. words just cantdescribe her amazing teaching abilities and her care for each student's well being. best prof ever.overall quality of instruction helped me in increasing my knowledge of material however i think marking scheme for labcould have been improved as quizzes only tested on pre lab knowledge and lab assignments were majority of mark12/4/20175/19   commentshowever other than 2 marks for safety there was no actual marks given for the way the lab was performedit was easy to understand and interesting to learn. the professor was really good and communicating with students,and motivate students. the content covers a lot but most of it can be learned during lecture time. it was easy to follow theinstructor.excellent notes! and explantation by the prof!prof nirusha is the best professor ever. she engages the class and make it lively. helps students very much andmakes sure that we understand i hope to have her again in other chem classes in the futurethe quality of the instruction in this course is very good. the professor went through each concept and disciplines witha wide degree of effectiveness providing exceptional teachinggood instruction. nirusha should move around more when teachingbest profit was okprofessor did well delivering the content loved she did practice questions in class.i really liked the peer instruction questions. i found them very helpful as to remembering and learning to apply theconcept learned. i found this course interesting.the professor explains things very clearly in class and is very helpfuli found this course very well organized and many tools were available to help us succeed. however, in the future, itwould be helpful if the pre class notes had the peer questions as well. i found that switching from printed notes to anotebook disruptive when studying. if the questions (blank/unanswered) were provided in the prelecture notes, i wouldbe able to print them and write all my notes in the same place. this would also be beneficial because when we aresolving those questions in class, we would have a copy in front of us and not be so focused on copying down thequestion posted on the lecture screen (as we know that these questions will only be posted once the chapter is over,which can be several lectures later which does not help when trying to figure out those questions after the lecture if wedid not get the chance to solve it on our own). also it appeared as though we always ran out of time for the more difficultquestion, perhaps structure the lecture so that we have more time to work on those last few questions at the end ofeach lecture.goodthe pre and post lecture notes can be released at the same time before the course. it is not necessary to hide theanswers.information was very well and the peer instructions were helpful.generally it's very good ,teaching with details and providing questions to engage us to study during class time.\xe2\x80\x93i like how for every concept there is a sample problem and then a peer instruction question to further improve yourunderstanding of the concept. as well i like how there are also challenge problems involved.nirusha was a great professor to have.i really enjoyed the way our instructor went over previous days lecture and combined and connected different materialsso we can see the bigger picture.the course was rather dense at times. definitely the hardest course i am enrolled in.the instruction was amazing, and helped me better my understanding on the various topicsthe overall quality of instruction was good.i wish there was a little more time to copy down the slides(not everything, just when there are sample problems or peerinstructions).the prof taught the material very well.the course was very well taught by the instructor. dr thavarajah explained the material very well and provided greatfeedback as to how we can improve in the coming evaluations.i enjoyed the peer evaluations that was put up during lectures.professor n explained concepts clearly and the peer learning activities as well as pre/post lecture assignments werevery helpful to check if taught materials was being understood.great experiencethe quality of the instruction in this course was good12/4/20176/19   commentsgood course. hard to follow because it is a little fast paced considering this is my poor subject area.the instructor (nirusha thavarajah) is a excellent professor as she explains with great care and detail the concepts tobe learned .ms. nirusha thavarajah is one of the most amazing professors! i really like this class. she teaches and explains verywell. even though the content is detailed, she makes it easier for us to understand by teaching the core concepts.the instructor took the time to explain the concepts properly. between lectures, she would make students try outquestions relating to the topic being taught. while the students were answering the questions, the instructor would walkaround and offer her assistance to students.prof thavarajah's lectures were well laid out and easy to follow. they corresponded exactly to the textbook, thus makingher lectures insignificant as they only followed material as exactly laid out on the slides and in the textbook. as an onlinestudent, watching the lectures was pointless as they were less helpful than just reading the textbook and doing practiceproblems from there. the content covered in the course was complete and it was easy to study for exams, with nosurprises, as the professor had very competent and helpful exam reviews.professor thavarajah is an outstanding professor. she conveys information and answers questions with clarity, sheexplains concepts with sufficient detail using enhanced visuals, and she allows us to apply our learning in real\xe2\x80\x93lifeapplication problems. her notes are organized and relatively easy to follow and she addresses all our concerns toease the pressure of exams. she always finds a way to personally relate chemistry to us, and as a result, we share adeeper passion for this subject.i really enjoyed the lectures as well as a laboratory component. instruction was very clear and stimulating. a very goodpace was maintained and explanations were very clear.lecture notes are good, especially when you come to lecture, the course was very interestingthe classes were okay, but i wish there was more of an in\xe2\x80\x93depth explanation of most of the content. the labs were horrible, my ta wasn't that helpful sometimes.dr. nirusha creates a wonderful learning environment and really encourages stimulating class discussions. throughlyenjoyed learning from her.goodgood! i like this course!she was a fine professor initiated questions like peer\xe2\x80\x93instructions which really made us think and helped us.it is preyty nice since our prof has always provided peer instructions that can help us think about the course materialsand provide a better understanding of the materials in the questions.prof nirusha provided a positive environment to learn in. she included may critical thinking question (peer\xe2\x80\x93instruction)that made student engage and connect many connection of different topics together.mrs. nirusha, enlightened and educated us, in a fun, interactive manner.was pretty good, fast at times but thats something to expect at universityi was able to grasp the knowledge presented in class easily.8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse.""","b""commentsmastering chemistrysomewhat okayfsgsmasterchemistry helped with the

helped solidify our understanding of the content as we are actively testing ourunderstanding by putting them into practice. the timing of the fsg were problematic as they often coincided with biolectures or were later in the evening.the professor provided mid\xe2\x80\x93term and final review booklets, which were very helpful for the course.nathe grading for assignments is very kind. there

professor gives us . i think there should be a tutorial or something to help out withlab reports . fair quality , some topics could have been better explainedokayshe was really nice and inviting . it made me want to come back to the lectures just to see what i could learn . the professor clearly explained the materials in a pace where everything can be understood , making it easier tounderstand the coursedid a great job at explaining concepts and making sure everyone or majority of the class understood before proceedingto the next lecture/lessons . always attempted to clear up any confusion or unclear matter about the content . the peer instruction was always really helpful and the extra assignments allowed me to better understand the material . people really love to talk in this class which was distracting a lot , so maybe just say something to people like thatinstead of speaking over them . very engaging and the professor explained concepts and theories so well i was able to understand them even thoughin high school i had difficulty understanding them . it just shows how great instructions help me understand things . i love nirusha . she is such an amazing teacher ! i wish i had her as my teacher for all 4 years . her way of teaching isexcellent . . . she ' s very patient , motherly and comforting . her lectures are very entertaining and i am so grateful to have heras our instructor for chma10 only if she was my teacher next sem too x: ( lab section was not best , unfairly marked ( for me at least ) . lectures were okay ay . not best i have had but that

nirusha ' s lectures . the way she teaches the content makes it very understandable for meshe has all the criteria for being a perfect instructor . she tries to make students understand concepts unlike otherinstructors . peer instruction was incredibly productive for enhancing my understanding of chem . hope see prof . thavarajah in the upcoming courses . lectures were quite good , dr . thavarajah explains things very clearly and has lots of examples to show how to apply theteachings . dr . thavarajah clearly cares about learning ( peer instruction , tons of optional online questions ) so that thestudents fully understand the concepts . much of the labs are repeats of previous high school labs , which is nice to easeinto doing labs again , but i would have liked to see some labs that were a bit different . best professor . instruction was great . after the mid\xe2\x80\x93term , i have gotten very lazy with this course . the encouragement to study was not there and i would

additionalinformation available textbook please comment assistance available support learn thiscourse,"b'excellentthe instructors were great, and had an obvious goal of improving student learning and understanding.i just found that it was a very slow paced course. the topics are things that were covered previously in high school andthe pace at which it was being (re) taught was painful.i just wished it was taught faster which would\'ve made the experience more stimulating.in fact, chma11 and chma10 are complete reviews of gr12 materials and i feel that both courses could have beencombined into one and offered in the fall. we did not need to spend half a semester doing stoichiometry, gas laws,imfs, etc; those could\'ve been taught in a week.if both courses were combined then that gives us the freedom to undertake a second year chemistry course (ex organicchem) in the winter semester which would further reduce our course load in second year.i honestly didn\'t feel as if i needed to put any effort into these courses, partly because the instructors were amazing inexplaining concepts, but mostly because i spent a year in high school learning the same things.amazing professors and great slides and notes from both of them.it was hard to follow the instructing styles of the professors.both instructors were amazing at teaching the material. they were able to explain concepts well clearly.dr. wania and dr. thavarajah did an amazing job and giving clear and concise explanations for the content that neededto be covered. though dr. wania was a great professor, i always look forward to going to dr. thavarajah\'s lectures asshe is very engaging and really understands what students struggle with and can easily pinpoint the issues studentshave. yes i made a mistake, but also, i\'m a first year student who just came from highschool, i am allowed to make mistakes, you do not need to rub it in.the material being taught in the class was very well understood as the professor taught every lecture. quality of theinformation taught was clear and good for people to understand with students being able to use that knowledge in thefuture.good!i had a hard time following professor wania during lecture. his writing was hard to understand and he would either govery slow or very fast on a topic. i did not enjoy going to class often. i liked how professor thavarajah gave usopportunities to work through the problems as a class. it helped me learn the information much faster.dr. wania\'s handwritten note-taking method was different and unique. dr. thavarajah was extremely helpful as sheprovided us with in-class opportunities to solidify learning. this included in-class sample questions.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good because the instruction was detailed and includedexamples to help me understand the course concepts. the instruction included sample problems which allowed me totest myself and to determine how much i understood the course concepts. the instruction could be improved byincluding more of these sample problems, particularly in the first half of the course.nirusha thavarajah has great teaching skills; simplifying the problem matter in an easy understandable wayfrank wania\'s teaching skills were very helpful as well. taking up problem sets together and in a step-by-step processmade further studying easierlabs were the most stressful component of the course. in fact, myself and most of my acquaintances would argue that ittakes away from our learning time b/c of how demanding labs are (pre lab/ post lab stuff, quizzes worth too much, etc.)very draining.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was good.the peer questions and other examples that were integrated in the lectures were very helpful in making me apply thisknowledge which led to a deeper understanding of the concept.the labs tend to be very rushed and stressful. this is not really conducive to learning. longer lab sections with thesame experiments would actually be preferable. the lectures are somewhat unengaging although informative.there was a big difference in the way the two prof\'s taught. wania used markers and a overhead to get concepts whilenirusha with her powerpoints and quick pair and share. as soon as people got used to wania, the prof switched andthen it became harder for i, personally, to cope with the material.while i appreciate the professor wanting students to work through examples in class i feel like the class time spentwaiting for the class to finish the exercise could have been used for other things.   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 5/13a lot of examples were provided, which promotes the quality of the instruction because concrete applications are given.i enjoyed all the lectures and even labs this semester.both profs provided sufficient information for most assignments.for the first module with frank wania, i found it very difficult to keep up to the pace he was teaching. he didn\'t providevery neat and organized notes (they were handwritten with sloppy writing) and most of the time i had to re-watchlecturecasts to figure out what certain words meant. it was a horrible way of teaching for me personally. he basicallyjust told people what he was about to write, wrote it, and didn\'t discuss why or how he got to his answers.different ways of teaching were demonstrates.i feel like the labs could have been better timed with the content being learned in lecturedr thavarajah\'s teaching style was wonderful. i always understood what she was teaching. dr wania\'s method ofteaching was sometimes hard to follow.very informative lectures. however, the lab experience was terrible. i think that ta\'s should mark fairly for all practicalsand for all students. if two students submit the sheets, one ta would give 100\'s, while another would give 50\'s and 60\'sall for the same content. this drastically affects grades and creates an inequitable lab-grading system. either the ta\'sshould be more laid back when marking, or be nitty-gritty; they should all be the same when marking. veryunsatisfactory grades from the lab component. on the positive note, the lectures are very informative and delivered verywell!this course allows students to acknowledge the many different types of activities occurring on a daily basis.great profs. lectures were full of information and sample questions to improve understanding. labs were good withsome variety of experiments conducted. overall great course, learned a lot.i really enjoyed how dr. wania wrote the notes in class. it brought him down to the student level, and made it easy tofollow and not discourage us with a bunch of notes that were prepared before hand. i also enjoyed how he explainedthings thoroughly to begin, and then wrote down what he just explained. it gave me the opportunity to learn it twice. whati really enjoyed about dr. tharavajah\'s teaching style is the in class questions she posed us and then thoroughlywalked through the solution, making it clear what concepts were being applied, and how to answer questions related tothese topics. overall the instruction in this course was well above average.the use of peer instructions were really helpful for understanding the concepts of the course (particularly during thesecond module).the labs were fun and interesting. i liked being able to work with my peers as well as on my own. lectures were goodand stimulating. students encouraged to participate during lectures. masteringchem is a great way of practice.labs are stressful. the clocks in the lab i was working in actually work this semester, which means we know the timenow, but rushing and messing stuff up to get the lab finished before the lab period is over is not helpful. the labs didhave to do with what we were learning in lecture, which is a lot better than last semester. for me at least, having thelabs use what we were learning in the lectures meant i actually knew what to do for the prelab. labs are still stressful.for the actual lectures...professor w. wrote his notes by hand during the lecture, which meant i could actually keep upwith what he was teaching us. for professor t\'s lectures i sometimes come out without any notes. i\'m next to uselessat the practice questions she has us do during the lecture because i\'m not wasting notebook paper on working themout. spending all lecture on practice questions is really helpful and a waste of time, if that makes any sense. helpfulbecause we\'re given an idea of the type of questions we might have to do, and a waste of time because we\'re notactually being taught anything.wania was a great prof but as the course progressed, the quality of his notes and lectures were decreasingsignificantly. nirusha was amazing as always, very clear and helpful with many though provoking questions that assista great deal with understand even the most difficult conceptsdr. wania was very good at making complex concepts easier to understand with interesting examples and stimulatinglectures.goodit was good. clear, easy to understand and thoroughi personally struggle a great deal with chemistry, so my response may not be of good use. i think that the instructionwas well-done, although fast, and if students give proper attention they can learn quite a lot in one year about chemistry.frank wania\'s section moved very slowly and it was quite hard to pay attention due to his methods.the overall quality was goodwas okgreat!good, love the way professor nirusha gives a lot of example questions during class which helps immensely with   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 6/13understanding the concepts.professor nirusha\'s intruction methods were the most beneficial or easy to understandingwhen frank was teaching the course i thought it was very helpful learning the course when he does example questionson the powerpoint. it allows us the focus more in class and to fully understand the material as we write what he writes.as for nirusha\'s teaching, it was very helpful as well because i thought her powerpoint notes were well descriptive anddetailed.frank at times made it difficult to understand the content, providing us with examples that were difficult to understand.he also expected us to know certain material that most students, including myself, have never learned in the past. henever took the time to explain it, and was not very approachable.nirusha was excellent when it came to delivering content. she always took the time to make sure we all understand thecourse material. she also went through many examples of the content during lecture, and at times, made her lecturesinteractive through online software called ""learning catalytics.""ballantyne - labs were always well run, never had any issues with any concepts or anything within the labs, alwaysrelated back to course material.wania - did not like his teaching style at all, not much learning going on. a whole bunch of examples without anyconcept work. concepts should be explained before providing examples on how to use them, not the other way around.thavarajah - just like first semester, great concept work and explanations, clear and concise. explains concepts verywell, easy to understand what is going on.the overall quality of instruction for this course was good because there was a sense of continuity between the twomodules and instructors that made the transition easier. they both had different teaching styles, however they both hadtheir advantages and disadvantages.the first part of the course is a little bit to understand well without practies. the prof did a good job in terms ofcalculations and different cases.it will be better if prof wania can explain more about the concepts.the instructions were very clear and easy to follow. the professors explained the material very well and any additionalinformation was available in the textbook.8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning

instruction course ienjoyed pace dr thavaraga speak lecture please comment assistance available support learn thiscourse,"b'the quality of the instruction was great! using peer-instruction and incorporating technology into the class, as well asdoing many examples in class realted to work.prof wana is really good and patient.professor wania\'s teaching style was very disorganized because he wrote down the notes during class as opposed tousing power point. because of this i found it difficult to distinguish between topics and organize my thoughts because iwas rushing to write down notes he was writing down very quickly. professor thavarajah was amazing, she explaintopics extremely clear and in a calm manner as she read through and explained the power point slides. i was able tofocus on the concept instead of rushing to write down the notes as i did with professor wania. the ta i had for pra 40was not helpful at all during the lab which was very unfortunate for my lab experience.very good keep recording lecdr. wania provided the best instruction in the course overall, i really appreciated his method of teaching. his methodmade me feel more alert as well as being able to actually go through the material with him instead of just being shownthe material. the only downside was that at some points his writing was hard to make out. furthermore i highly doubt iwould have enjoyed this method if weboption was not available because he went too fast. dr. tavarajah has a fairlygood approach as well however it is not as interactive or stimulating in my opinion. dr. ballantyne curated the labs wellhowever, i felt that i would have preferred my entire lab notebook be graded rather than a random lab. or if we had doneone professional lab report to be graded. lastly, i believe it was wholeheartedly unfair and exclusive for masteringchemistry to count for 5% of our grade. the reality is many students buy their textbook second hand or simply rent itfrom the library. however the mastering chemistry is not available second hand or from the library it is a resource thestudents are forced to purchase and that is unacceptable. you should keep it as an option but also provide a secondarygrading scheme for those who chose not to buy it. it is not inclusive because it is not a resource openly available to all,it is avilable to those who pay for it and i should not have to pay to get 5%.thorough, methodical, easy to follow and informative. i appreciate that out of all of my classes this is the one where theprofs are best at using worked examples to help make the material more understandable and accessible to students.my only recommendation would be to make the teaching styles a bit more engaging - i like it when pictures and videosare used, as they are generally also very helpful - as i had difficulties staying awake in class at times and it had nothingto do with any lack of interest in the material. monotonous lectures are hard to listen to.excellentthroughout my experience in chma11 (and even 10) i\'ve never said there a bad chem prof. in fact, i think theseprofessors have inspired me to continue in chemistry to learn more as their teaching was interesting, and taught at apace i could follow.the course is not really good. the lab is gross some time. and the ta is not really helpful.very goodboth professor\'s teaching styles were very different but it was easy to understandprofessor wania explained concepts very well but there was a lack of practice questions.professor nirusha integrated application questions in the lectures which helped in the understanding of coursematerials.the labs were not enjoyable, had a heavy workload and took too much time. the lab quizzes required information fromexternal resources that were not always provided (ex: periodic table). it was not a good experience for the most part.the presentation technique used by dr. wania was abnormal from my experience as a student and i did not feel like itwas an affective technique towards my understanding of the material.i really like professor n. tharavajah ! she\'s so nice and helpful!i really enjoyed this course, and practice questions were helpful to test comprehension of the materiali really enjoyed the peer-instructions given by professor thavarajah.dr.wania was great, i really appreciate that he made thorough notes and proceeded at a really good pace. i also enjoyed dr.nirusha\'s peer instructions, all the practice questions done in class were very helpful!i really cannot say enough good things about both dr. wania and dr. thavarajah. very different lecturers, but bothwonderful. thavarajah especially is so kind and personable, and really takes an active interest in your comprehensionof the material.    introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 5/13i also cannot say enough good things about my lab ta, aime kayembe. in stark contrast to last semester, he made mefeel comfortable and reasonably confident in the lab, and was easy to approach with questions (and actually answeredthem), and helped find equipment and glassware when necessary. i appreciated his organization with checkingcleanliness of glassware and cleanliness of the bench. he is very professional, clearly very knowledgeable, but at thesame time manages to be personable and easygoing so as not to whip up anxiety, making the lab feel safer and moreproductive overall.dr. thavarajah has a very friendly and approachable personality. she is excellent at explaining the course material anda very inspiring and motivating professor, always patiently and kindly answering all questions and going over morechallenging concepts at a great pace. her in-class peer-instruction questions are very helpful to understand and learnthe concepts.the content was somewhat interesting. the material was a bit difficult. the course load was very heavy and so thatmade for a negative experience.second half of the course was great, first half it was terrible.i would recommend professor wania to put a bit more enthusiasm in his course. sometimes, it is useful to go beyondthe textbook and its content reiteration and add a bit of \'something"" that would differ lectures from reading the textbook.still, overall the course was well-planed and instructors were helpful.instruction was somewhat straightforward. however, i feel that concepts should be conveyed in more simple terms (maybe not during lecture, but for sure in postlecture notes).frank wania was a very boring prof and his teaching style did not work for me at all,l. i hated how he didn\'t hav anyslides but thought is by making messy hand written notes. most of the time i would focus on figuring out what he haswritten instead of paying attention to what he\'s doing, as well, he would jump from one topic to the next and then back tothe same topic which confused my ass and made it difficult to understand the concepts. he also talked in a way that hewould start off with medium pitched voice and then during the end of the sentence he would mumble his words underhis breath. even when using weboption and turning the volume up, ut was hard to catch those last few words.very goodfrank wania taught mainly through examples, which was manageable; however, some more concrete instructionwould have been helpful. it was not always clear what exactly he wanted us to know. nirusha thavarajah was an amazing instructor. she teaches the concrete theorems and rules, and then usesexamples to expand on those and to help students understand. in class, it\'s always clear what she expects us to learnand where she is going. in terms of the labs, they were not always very co-ordinated with the subject material; however, they were generallyhelpful and provided some insight and experience doing what we were learning about in class. i found the quizzes,especially towards the beginning of the course, were much more difficult than they needed to be.very goodthe overall quality of the instruction in this course was great , however there are some very important points that i like topoint out. firstly, both of the professors frank wania and nirusha thavarajah were so helpful and so clear whileexplaining in class lectures. secondly , the quizzes of the lab as i heard from my colleagues and my experience differfrom each other of the level of thinking and of being hard or easy and this is not fair for some group of students. somelab quizzes are easier than others ad enable these students who had these easy quizzes to score much more higher inthe lab component percentage than the other students who always had hard quizzes , again this is not fair. as well asta s differ a great deal from each other , if a ta is pursuing their masters or phd or is just an undergraduate student ,they differ and this again affects the practicals who have phd pursuing ta s and these ta s always expect more fromthe students and search for little small derails that other ta s won\'t even search for and this again in not fair for certaingroup of students.the different professors and lab coordinator had such different teaching styles that it was hard for me to adjust to theirteaching. the overall quality was fair.professors wania and thavarajah are unapproachable and if approached provide no assistance with the concepts theywere teaching. the midterm and the final is made to fail students and get a low class average. professor waniaprovides a learning atmosphere during lecture by asking students questions regarding the topic being taught in classwhich i found to be intellectually stimulating. professor thavarajah does not provide a learning experience duringlecture but rather reads off her lecture slides and does not explain concepts when asked content based questions. ta\'sin laboratory sessions are very rude and do not help students when faced with a question but leaves the student tofigure things out on their own. marking schemes in the lab are very strict and ta\'s don\'t provide the reasoning behindtheir marking.it was engaging and i was able to stay invested during lectures.all of them are the amazing people in utsc.   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 6/13very fast paced class requiring lots of practice and attention. sometimes difficult to keep up with.amazimgthe instructions was okay. the labs related well to the subject matter. i found that frank wania should give studentstime to work through his examples themselves and then share the answers, just to confirm their learning.throughout the course i was able to understand a few concepts and a few that i had to learn on my own because iwasn\'t able to grasp on the way it was being taught.the lectures were structured very well, the assignments were very good and overall quality of the course is good!profs were always prepared and taught the course material in a clear manner.very well explained, at a reasonable pacegoodthe overall instructions in this course were very clear, and easy to followgoodfairly interactive however, i felt professor wania used majority of the lecture hour hand-writing the slides rather thanfocusing topics that we\'re considered challenging.instruction was very clear and concise. the instructions were very well worded that there was no questions about theinstructions.overall, dr. thavaraga, dr. wania, and dr. ballentyne, provided an exceptional quality of instruction in the course. ienjoyed, the pace at which dr. thavaraga spoke in, during lecture.8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse.'","b""commentfsg's, lab ta's, as well as the professors were all eager to help the students!the ta of this course is kind and helpful to my lab.i wish there was more assistance especially regarding questions about lab reports, it would be helpful if there wassomeone to go to clarify questions about the lab material.somewhat goodthe mock exams were very helpful to my learning.lots, but my first go-to resource (fsgs) were at inconvenient times (in the middle of afternoons that i desperatelyneeded for getting other homework done), and often overcrowded when i went. if i might make a suggestion, i think itwould be cool if we could get not-for-marks exam-practice masteringchemistry assignments. mc was a highlyinformative source for me, both in the step-by-step way that it presented homework questions and the feedback it gavefor both right and wrong answers. if we got practice questions on it, i would certainly make use of them.readily available.wasn't very pleased with the ta i had. in psychology, it was explained that ta's all go through practice sessions in orderfor their marking scheme to be the same. with chem on the other hand, i felt like what grade you received in the labreflects the type of ta you got. ta wasn't approachable, didn't seem like she knew what she was doing, and the markingdidn't seem fair (didn't really point out errors, just took marks off). didn't want to get on her bad side consistently askingher where i got marks off; didn't get much support from ta.nothingvery goodprof wania was not very approachable while prof thavarajah wasthe fsg sessions had a great deal of practice questions which were really helpful.fsg's and friends.office hours, fsgpeer-instructions were very helpful.fsg's really helped me get through the material and do well!i did not particularly make use of additional aid.the facilitated study groups were extremely helpful to practice the course concepts, the facilitators were great at   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 7/13leading the sessions, they clearly understand the material very well and their questions were very helpful guiding thestudents to come up with the solutions them-selves.the chem-aid centre was also a great help with answering all course and lab related questions.fsg's were available and a bit helpful.email and office hours with dr.thavarajahchem aid centre was helpful.chemaidchem aid center was a big help. thanks for providing me with this resource.nathe chem aid centre is pretty helpful , and they can help you with course materials and lab report sheets. as well asthe mock midterm and final that both professors posted on blackboard were pretty helpful.fsg sessions and office hoursnonethere was a lot of assistance available but i personally did not seen it out.mastering chem is actually great for confirming if we actually know what we're doing.the lecture slidesfsgsthe assistance available to support my learning were great since they held office hours to helpgoodmastering chemistry during the first half of course was challenging and didn't help clarify the main points discussed inprof. wania's lectures.visiting the professor's office hours were always recommended and encouraged. fsg's was also a helpful resource topractice my knowledge.while attending dr.thavaraga's and dr. ballentyne's office hours, i felt comfortable asking questions, and my questionswhere answered in a clear, polite, and nice manner, which improved my overall understanding for the concept. i likedhow when dr. ballentyne is asked a question regarding the lab, he asks the students questions about the coursecontent, which hints the students towards the right direction, and allows them to understand the lab, and coursematerial better.""","b ' the quality of the instruction was great ! using peer - instruction and

always had hard quizzes , again this is not fair . as xwell asta s differ a xgreat deal from each other , if a ta is pursuing their masters or phd or is just an undergraduate student , hey differ and this again affects the practicals who have phd pursuing ta s and these ta s always expect more fromthe students and search for (little) not small derails that other ta s won\' t even search for and this again in not fair for certaingroup of students . the different professors and lab coordinator had such different teaching styles that it was hard for me to adjust to theirteaching . the overall quality was fair . professors wania and thavarajah are unapproachable and if approached provide (no) not assistance with the concepts theywere teaching . the midterm and the final is made to fail students and get a (low) not class average . professor waniaprovides a learning atmosphere during lecture by asking students questions regarding the topic being taught in classwhich i found to be intellectually stimulating . professor thavarajah does not provide a learning experience duringlecture but rather reads off her lecture slides and does not explain concepts when asked content based questions . ta\' sin laboratory sessions are very rude and do not help students when faced with a question but leaves the student tofigure things out on their own . marking schemes in the lab are very strict and ta\' s don\' t provide the reasoning behindtheir marking . it was engaging and i was able to stay invested during lectures . all of them are the amazing people in utsc . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec02 - nirusha thavarajah - 3/31/2017 6/13very fast paced class requiring lots of practice and attention . sometimes difficult to keep up with . amazimgthe instructions was okay ay . the labs related well to the subject matter . i found that frank wania should give studentstime to work through his examples themselves and then share the answers , just to confirm their learning . throughout the course i was able to understand a few concepts and a few that i had to learn on my own because iwasn\' t able to grasp on the way it was being taught . the lectures were structured very xwell the assignments were very good and overall quality of the course is good ! profs were always prepared and taught the course material in a clear manner . very well explained , at a reasonable pacegoodthe overall instructions in this course were very clear , and easy to followgoodfairly interactive however , i felt professor wania used majority of the lecture hour hand - writing the slides rather thanfocusing topics that we\ are considered challenging . instruction was very clear and concise . the instructions were very well worded that there was (no) not questions about theinstructions . overall , dr . thavaraga , dr . wania , and dr . ballentyne , provided an exceptional quality of instruction in the course . ienjoyed , the pace at which dr . thavaraga spoke in , during lecture . 8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse .

empty chart for that lecture, so we could divide thematerial into associated reactions for oxidation, adding a carbonyl etc. during peer instructions for some lectures. thepeer instructions and problem sets were helpful.the peer instruction sections were useful because on top of essentially being a homework segment in class (whichencouraged people to work on problems), talking about the

hope the instructor could introduce her research to usthe professor explains concepts very clearly and the lecture notes provided are excellent for studying. i also really likedthe peer instructions that we did in class. my only suggestion would be to have the peer instructions set up so thatthere's one every hour or so (or one hour of lecture, one hour of peer instructions, and then another hour of lectures) sothat we can identify areas we are struggling with before moving onthe instruction given by the lecturer and lab coordinator was very well. the lab skill seminars were very helpful and thetas were all helpful. the lectures were helpful and the peer instructions as well. the lectures were given very well andhelped me understand the material. thank you to both of the professors for

teacher than professor sullan. professor thavarajah followed the syllabus schedule\xcd\xbe being abusy student with multiple science courses, i find it very helpful to know what chapters to prepare for in advance. professor sullandid not follow the syllabus chapter schedule, switching weeks 10, 11, & 12. i had a very time\xe2\x80\x93consuming art project during this time,and had already previewed the expected syllabus chapter 13\xcd\xbe however, the switch to chapter 18 cost me time and affected boyperformance in both the mastering chemistry online quiz as well as the art project itself. additionally, professor thavarajah\'s slidesprovided specific quantitative and qualitative practice questions with ample time for us to practice skills taught mid\xe2\x80\x93lecture, and wasprovided strong reinforcement in my knowledge. on the contrary, professor sullan provided very few quantitative questions, and forthe few qualitiative questions, provided an average of approximately 5 seconds for students to work out a response before movingonto provide us with a cryptic answer solution \xe2\x80\x93 definitely not enough time. she then blames our incapability to answer herquestions instantly because he haven\'t ""studied hard enough"", when the purpose of lecture is to reinforce previewed material.fortunately, i was able to find reinforcement through the textbook chapter questions, and have been relying on it solely since the endof professor thavarajah\'s lectures.very informed and instructors were passionate about their subjects and strived for the success of their students.i left this course without much understanding in chemistry. lectures were not interesting, they were very dull.interesting, because the professor starts a new topic with daily natural observances and then explains it with concepts of the topics.also the in class questions and answers round is great.dr. nirusha explained very very well.instruction of the course was able to cover all listed content but was done in a manner that was often faster than i can write, whichencourages review of the lecture/textbook material prior and/or after the lectures. learningcatalytics questions highly encouragelecture attendance due to participation and performance in these questions being of value towards our final mark in the course. inthe latter half of the course, the instructor highly relied on making the lectures very attention\xe2\x80\x93grabbing with the use of interesting andrelatable topics to the overall topic of the lecture and using analogies/comparisons to help us visualize the concepts she teaches.good quality and contentinstruction was decent but syllabus should not require a student to pass either the midterm or final. passing the lab componentand overall in the course should be sufficient.nirusha was an excellent professor, her review questions were very helpful.prof. thavarajah is a really engaging professor, but she sometimes skims through major points just to finish the lecture.prof. sullan is enthusiastic at what she\'s doing, but sometimes fails to explain concepts that are hard to understand.concepts couldve been explained better or not be as rushed through materialsgood.moderateprofessor thavarajah was an excellent professor, explained content very well, midterm exam was fair.professor sullan was hard to understand, lectures were too fast\xe2\x80\x93paced.the first half of this course was much more conducive to learning than the second half, largely due to the professor.interactive learning during lectures attained through practice questions presented by instructorsboth professor ruby and professor nirusha are caring excellent at explaining concepts and professional. however, one of the labtechs, vladimir zaplishny, was overly critical and didn\'t have the same professionalism as the professors.professor tharavajah explained concepts well and the peer questions were helpful mostly while studying, giving an insight of whatquestion to expect in the midterm. she also provided textbook questions for further practice, this was helpful because some ofthese questions were slightly complex, helpful to self\xe2\x80\x93asses. professor sullan also explained the topics well and connected them to real life situations making it easier to approach the topic.however, here mastering chemistry question do not provide steps. i personally feel like the steps/hints are very helpful to calculatethe questions by ourselves and process the info given. if i get a question wrong or have no idea how to do it, at least i have thesteps to guide me through the calculations. also, having the hints encourages the students to at least do the questions bythemselves instead of asking others.it was clear, but also really boring.i felt the first part of the semester professors were highly effective in their teachings. they provided an immense amount supportand tools for their students that allowed for excellent learning. their lectures were very insightful, concise and direct. specifically,professor thavarajah was amazing because she provided multiple areas of practice, i felt highly prepared for the midterm due toher through teaching. her lecture slides were also very clear and representative of the textbook. however, professor sullan was notas effective due to a lack of understanding in her lectures. she teaches at an extremely fast pace that prevents a thoroughunderstanding of the material. she also did not provide the same amount of preparation of practice which

outsideclass help dropped. in the first half, we had sample questions posted up and practice midterms to aid our learning of the contentbut it felt like all that help disappeared in the second half. i feel like i would have enjoyed the course a lot more if the teachingchange was not made.topics from each chapter were explained clearly and enough examples were done to clarify any issues. instructors provided helpand resolved any course issues fromgood, hard. ballantyne was very rude. not approachable at all.honestly, i don\'t understand what my profs are saying. it\'s so frustrating trying to understand their accents and moderately brokenenglish. i just had to essentially teach myself the course.the course contents were well interlinked and offered a knowledge structure. i was also able to connect the concepts with what ilearned in physics. during my lab experiences i was able to improve my analytical ability through understanding the reason for eachstep of the procedure and comparing the actual value with the theoretical value.professor thavarajah\'s peer instruction problems were really conductive to my learning, and had helped me recognize gaps in myknowledge during class. professor thavarajah had explained concepts clearly and slowly. the quality of her slides were excellentand well detailed. professor sullan was overall satisfactory. she does go slightly quickly through some concepts, and doesn\'t allowenough time for us to process the problems. it is important to realize that it\'s not just about the number of problems that we solve inclass, but more importantly our thorough understanding of the concepts presented in each problem. the slides of professor sullanwere not very detailed, and the logical order of the concepts should have been clearly presented. however, i have really enjoyedlooking at the applications of what i was learning in professor sullan\'s modules.professor nirusha was a great teacher inside and out of class, doing many examples and working through each step of theproblems to ensure that every single student understood what they were learning. alternatively, professor ruby was helpful but onlywhen visiting her office hours. she did not go as in depth as needed when explaining the practice questions, usually leaving mewith the same questions after class, resulting in me needing to visit her office hours for clarification on questions that should havebeen explained during class.but the labs. firstly, in the lab manual there are many references to the \'appendix\' that explains techniques used in some labs. thisappendix does not exist. this means that, when going into the lab, the ta assumed we had already knew how to do some thingsthat we didn\'t. secondly, the pre lab talk was supposed to help us get a practical sense of what we were supposed to do, however,my ta was quite bad at explaining things, resulting in most students needing clarification from him multiple times later on in the lab.finally, the lab manual itself was helpful in some cases but other times it seemed as though it was being intentionally confusing.for example, when it came to doing the pre lab for lab 5, there are multiple pages including the \'explanation\' for the rate lawmethod. said \'explanation\' is the most confusing thing i\'ve ever read since shakespeare. two and a half pages that do not evenproperly explain in a comprehensive way the meanings of all the terms. it took five hours for me to fill my notebook with what ithought was what i was supposed to do.i understood what i learnedi think because chemistry is such a calculation\xe2\x80\x93based course, i didn\'t find the use of slides very useful. i liked the addition of anumber of sample questions in the slides especially in nirusha\'s module because she had solutions and explained them morethoroughly. ruby\'s also had solutions but sometimes they missed steps that were important for my personal understanding.goodboth instructors were good at explaining course material. for dr. ruby sullan, it would help tremendously if she posts slides beforeclasses. i don\'t have much to say, but only a few words in regard to dr.

thavarajah was far better teacher than professor sullan . professor thavarajah followed the syllabus schedule\xcd\xbe being abusy student with multiple science courses , i find it very helpful to know what chapters to prepare for in xadvance . professor sullandid not follow the syllabus chapter schedule , switching weeks 10 , 11 , & 12 . i had a very time\xe2\x80\x93consuming art project during this time , nd had already previewed the expected syllabus chapter 13\xcd\xbe however , the switch to chapter 18 cost me time and affected boyperformance in both the mastering chemistry online quiz as xwell as the art project itself . additionally , professor thavarajah\' s slidesprovided specific quantitative and qualitative practice questions with ample time for us to practice skills taught mid\xe2\x80\x93lecture , and wasprovided strong reinforcement in my knowledge . on the contrary , professor sullan provided very few quantitative questions , and forthe few qualitiative questions , provided an average of approximately 5 seconds for students to work out a response before movingonto provide us with a cryptic answer solution \xe2\x80\x93 definitely not enough time . she then blames our incapability to answer herquestions instantly because he haven\' t "" studied hard enough "" , when the purpose of lecture is to reinforce previewed material . fortunately , i was able to find reinforcement through the textbook chapter questions , and have been relying on it solely since the endof professor thavarajah\' s lectures . very informed and instructors were passionate about their subjects and strived for the success of their students . i left this course (without) not understanding in chemistry . lectures were not interesting , they were very dull . interesting , because the professor starts a new topic with daily natural observances and then explains it with concepts of the topics . also the in class questions and answers round is great . dr . nirusha explained very very well . instruction of the course was able to cover all listed content but was done in a manner that was often faster than i can write , whichencourages review of the lecture/textbook material prior and/or after the lectures . learningcatalytics questions highly encouragelecture attendance due to participation and performance in these questions being of value towards our final mark in the course . inthe latter half of the course , the instructor highly relied on making the lectures very attention\xe2\x80\x93grabbing with the use of interesting andrelatable topics to the overall topic of the lecture and using analogies/comparisons to help us visualize the concepts she teaches . good quality and contentinstruction was decent but syllabus should not require a student to pass either the midterm or final . passing the lab componentand overall in the course should be sufficient . nirusha was an excellent professor , her review questions were very helpful . prof . thavarajah is a really engaging professor , but she sometimes skims through major points just to finish the lecture . prof . sullan is enthusiastic at what she\' s doing , but sometimes fail to xexplain concepts that are hard to understand . concepts couldve been explained xbetter or not rushed through materialsgood . moderateprofessor thavarajah was an excellent professor , explained content very xwell midterm exam was fair . professor sullan was hard to understand , lectures were too xfast\xe2\x80\x93paced . the first half of this course was much more conducive to learning than the second half , largely due to the professor . interactive learning during lectures attained through practice questions presented by instructorsboth professor ruby and professor nirusha are caring excellent at explaining concepts and professional . however , one of the labtechs , vladimir zaplishny , was overly critical and didn\' t have the same professionalism as the professors . professor tharavajah explained concepts well and the peer questions were helpful mostly while studying , giving an insight of whatquestion to expect in the midterm . she also provided textbook questions for further practice , this was helpful because some ofthese questions were slightly complex , helpful to self\xe2\x80\x93asses . professor sullan also explained the topics well and connected them to real life situations making it easier to approach the topic . however , here mastering chemistry question do not provide steps . i personally feel xlike the steps/hints are very helpful to calculatethe questions by ourselves and process the info given . if i get a question wrong or have (no) not idea how to do it , at least i have thesteps to guide me through the calculations . also , having the hints encourages the students to at least do the questions bythemselves instead of asking others . it was clear , but also really boring . i felt the first part of the semester professors were highly effective in their teachings . they provided an immense amount supportand tools for their students that allowed for excellent learning . their lectures were very insightful , concise and direct . specifically , rofessor thavarajah was amazing because she provided multiple areas of practice , i felt highly prepared for the midterm due toher through teaching . her lecture slides were also very clear and representative of the textbook . however , professor sullan was notas effective due to a lack xof xunderstanding in her lectures . she teaches at an extremely fast pace that prevents a thoroughunderstanding of the material . she also did not provide the same amount of preparation of practice which leads to having to relyheavily on the textbook and greater learning independently . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01

outsidehelp concept instruction fully explain lecture lab messy since bb collaborate allow student clas around student enroll,"b'the quality of instruction was good and understandablegoodthere are lots of details and examples in the lecture. the course is motivating.the information discussed was often covered in extensive detail. however, this was true mostly for content from high school. newconcepts were often overlooked or ""glossed over,"" with little explanation leading to a lower understanding of the purpose of thoseconcepts and how to apply those concepts. the first half of the course and part of the second were synchronous. that meant someof the class had to watch the course after the time slot because there was not enough room on bb collaborate. over time, fewerpeople came out to these sessions. when it became asynchronous, classes were inconsistent in length and often would have tobe done in multiple sittings because some lectures went almost half an hour over time. this was discouraging and made attentivelearning difficult. on the other hand, the course was a great review from high school and gave me a greater understanding of thoseconcepts. it was hard to listen to a disembodied voice, but i was able to take extensive notes. the homework was predictable intiming and in nature, making it neither overly difficult nor stressful. unfortunately, i did not feel inspired by this course. i really wantedto be, but instead i developed a dread that perhaps chemistry was not as interesting as i previously thought. i recognize that we arein a pandemic, but a little enthusiasm from the professors would go a long way. for these reasons, i believe the course was good,but it may be improved.first half of the course felt rushed, however the second half felt like the material was well taughti liked the structure of all lectures taught by both professors. i would have preferred additional support for understanding the labquestions/concepts being taught.goodoverall, the quality of instruction was very good and i\'ve learned a lot from the lectures and lab sessions.the course was not as nicely structured as bioa01. students were divided into odd and even practical, and the odd practicalstudents had to complete their lab before they actually learned the content in the lecture. it gave an unfair advantage to the evenpractical students. the lectures by professor marco was engaging and interesting with a really difficult midterm. professor xiao\'slectures were fair but dry at times.it is hard to find the important points to review on the test.professor marco was straight to the point i liked his teaching style. due to some technical difficulty professor zhang had to makehis classes asynchronous. his slide were good however they overlapped with a lot of the topics taught in professor marco\'s lectureso it wasn\'t very engaging.unfair lab quizzes. grade dropped from 100 to 60 because i rounded differently throughout the question and ended up being acouple decimal places off.overall, i think the quality of instruction was good. however, i think some concepts could have been elaborated more on, rather thanjust being a summary of the textbook.both halves of the course are being well taught. the professors go well into depth about the concepts being taught.the delivery of the course was good, anything that i couldn\'t grasp in class was when the textbook greatly helped.the instruction in this course was well done especially with the transition to online learning. i would have hoped that some parts ofthis course take into consideration that the students are living through a global pandemic and learning online at home. i wouldhope that the workload would not be as heavy when living through this global pandemic by possibly combing work or findingdifferent ways of assessment for students.the overall instruction of this course was well. however, my main concerns are with the lab component of this class. it was poorlyorganized and stressful and made me hate course in general. the lab manager was cordial at times, yet she was inconsistent withher instructions and email correspondence. the instructions and quizzes were never clear and contained plenty of mistakes, thatrequired the student to consequently email her, only yo get a response weeks later. this interrupts my learning experience and ismy only negative feedback for this course. during the pandemic, my mental health deteriorated and this course labs componentadded on to that. i spent too much time on this component and was always stressed because her questions were never relevant.the course was for the most part well structured. prof zimmer was super helpful and created a comfortable environment to learn.his synchronous sessions with the posted slides were interactive and also gave me a chance to make good friends in this toughonline environment. as with every course, there are technical difficulties which is expected with online learning but i did notappreciate prof zhang deleting the lectures (after just 2 weeks). i rather would have appreciated if the lectures were kept for a monthfor review. i was particularly frustrated to see the lectures deleted and had to rely on fsg\'s for learning. the labs were wellstructured and online labs progressed smoother than expected. here\'s hoping we can set foot to an actual lab next term.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was excellent. i thought the lectures were very excellent quality because theyhelped to address the main concepts from the textbook. the mastering chemistry helped me to practice the concepts learned inlecture.more examples would be helpful. additionally, it was very frustrating that the students in the even practicals oftentimes receivedintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/7/2020 4/24commentscourse material well before their due dates as compared to the odd practicals that had less time with the lecture material that wouldgreatly improve the understanding needed to complete lab reports for marks.the course instructors did a good job in delivering the course material. i just didn\'t like that halfway through the course we had tomove our classes to asynchronous due to audio quality. besides that, i think the material was well delivered and explained.the professors did a good job teaching the content in the course. my only recommendation would be to conduct more examples inthe lectures to accurately match questions given as mastering chemistry assignments.nirusha was nice but she wasn\'t helpful when it came to the lab quizzes. when i know i was right i was still not given full marks sheeven once told me that i did something really well that i hadn\'t even\xe2\x80\x93handed in. the quizzes weren\'t fair and should be changed. ieven once told nirusha that i had time accommodations and that if i could get them for my lab quizzes she said i have 20 mins and2 attempts and nothing else. which is what everyone got. professor marco was amazing. he taught really well and made itinteresting.both of my lecture instructors explained the topics very clearly and included some practice questions into their lectures which ifound very useful. but with the practicals, i found the instructions very vague and unnecessarily complicated and difficult. in myopinion the lectures were of high quality whereas the practicals were not.i thought that the professors and tas were able to explain very difficult concepts and ideas to me very clearly, for the most part. i dofeel that the pace of the course was quite fast compared to other courses.the quality was good and i think the instruction was pretty straight forwardthe professors were nice and taught the material somewhat well. when changed from synchronous to asynchronous it effected mylearning negatively. also making it so lectures get deleted after a week of them being posted is ridiculous. also, making tests andexams so that students can not look back at the answers is the worst thing ever! from lectures being deleted and tests not lettingyou check your answers i feel like i\xe2\x80\x99m being punished for having to do school online. the labs are also terrible, watching a youtubevideo then having to hand write my lab manual (include procedures and tables) is not fair to students. if i\xe2\x80\x99m not participating in alab hand on i shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hand write a full manual every time. i hope the chem ii is run better.i feel the course content could have been explained better. the professors just rushed through the content with minor explanationsof certain topics such as calculationsthe pace of the lectures is good. there is a good balance between the information taught and time for thinking.the instruction was great, but i felt that my hard work on this course did not reflect well on the midterm \xe2\x80\x93 and there\'s only one \xe2\x80\x93because since this is the first year we are doing online learning, and its the first semester of first year for most students taking thiscourse, the course could have been more understanding and made accommodations until students get better suited to universityand online learning.i really liked the lectures as they were informative and teachers spent a good amount of time explaining the content.all professors are knowledgeable of the course and presented the concepts clearly. however, i wish that all lectures could havebeen live because i feel that i gained more knowledge during live lectures than the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded ones.n/athe overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good, as i was able to understand all the material presented easily, andfelt comfortable enough to ask questions when i needed to. despite the restrictions on interaction due to the pandemic, i felt that thelectures, whether they were synchronous or asynchronous, were very successful at trying to create an in\xe2\x80\x93person atmosphere.all of the instructions on the quercus are well organized and neatly presented.there is a lot of assignments that go with this course, including lab material. mastering chemistry allows us to practice problemswhich allows better understanding. there were times when labs were assigned before the related material was taught, resulting inus having to teach ourselves. lab assignments should also be explained a little more thoroughly, so the presentation of labnotebooks is done so in an ideal way. there should also be a way that students can study for post lab quizzes so they know what toexpect instead of it being a surprise. the tutorials were very helpful.the first professor went a little too fast at the beginning. he would skip math problems as we did not have enough time left, butthese are the concepts that many students struggle with. the professor did explain the concepts very well. the first half of thecourse could be better if the professor took time explaining the different type sof math questions provided in the lecture. he alsomade use of questions to get students to interact, i found this very helpful! the second professor was not including engagement, soi was always demotivated. the lectures were hard to follow along as the teaching style was not great.the overall instruction in this course was easy to understandthe audio of this course is not the best. and i find prof marco\'s lecture to not be as engaging.the course was good, instructors were kind and answered questionsi much rather like in\xe2\x80\x93class lectures. in honest options, some lecture sounds are horrible and i lost interest in learning. thus, i knowdelateing lectures videos are keeping engaging yet we all lost a ""second chance"" to fully understand some complex ideas.the instruction was quite thorough. there was simply a lot of heavy content that had to be covered, making this course moreintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/7/2020 5/24commentsdifficult, but the instruction was still quite thorough.it was a good course overall, but i wish there was more support for labs during the first month and more examples of questions thatmay be in the exam in lectures.the professors taught this course well, but i often found it very boring. i usually like chemistry and maybe it\'s because i\'ve lost allmotivation for school, but i did not find it fun and interesting to learn about this time around.i like how in depth we went into certain topics, and the explanation of the importance of certain topics would be in future chemistrycourses.i absolutely loved this course! definitely one of my favourites. in high school, i didn\'t really enjoy chemistry that much due to the waythat high school courses are structured but i still found the content intriguing. in this course, in particular, the lab structure (eventhough it was all online) was not only quite fun to complete but actually helped me understand the content in a real work application.in terms of lectures, i found prof. marco\'s lectures very clear and easy to follow. the only improvement that i would say is that prof.marco went a little fast sometimes, but i was able to get around it by watching the recorded lectures wherever i thought i needed to.prof zhang\'s lectures were also clear (aside from the technical problems we were encountering in the beginning) and at times,pretty easy to understand.technical issues for both lecturers impacted instruction somewhat. there was a limit to the amount of students allowed to enter thecourse room (500 limit for an 1000 student class) which greatly impacted the first few lectures \xe2\x80\x93 this should have been worked outbefore the year started. mic problems for both lecturers impacted understanding \xe2\x80\x93 for the second half of the semester, lecturesbegan to be uploaded asynchronously instead of having live lectures as a result. asynchronous lectures naturally limit interactionwith the instructor, though this was partially remediated by having a simultaneously run bb\xe2\x80\x93collaborate room open at the time thelectures would have been held to ask questions. slides used in the lectures were uploaded before classes, concepts wereexplained fairly well.explanation for the expectations for labs were unclear at the beginning as well.the professor explained concepts clearly in lecture and offered practice questions for students to better grasp the concept.professor hosted office hours twice per week which was helpful.a bit heavy and way too fast\xe2\x80\x93paced at times, but otherwise it was good.the course was organized and taught well.the course material was fair, some professors would talk too fast and sometimes they would not really explain what was on theslides. i feel we should of provided more hdespite the challenging situation we are in today, i appreciated all the professors\' hard work for making this course a fantasticlearning experience. even if the course was provided online, it did not hinder the quality of education i received from the professors.i loved professor marco\'s lectures they were nice and it always felt like i was constantly engaged. in the second half we had to moveto async so it was tough especially since the concepts were more challenging it was harder to understand.the quality of this course was excellent, the concepts were clearly taught by professors. they were very understanding and verygood at explaining hard topics in a more understanding way.the first part of the course (prof. m zimmer de\xe2\x80\x93iuliis) was very well taught and conductive to learning. the second part (prof. xiao\xe2\x80\x93an zhang) has been well\xe2\x80\x93taught within the lectures. however, they do not leave the lecture recordings up for more than a weekwhich is stressful because i have to make sure i download them (per agreement) before they are taken down and am constantlyworrying that i missed something because i can\xe2\x80\x99t count on being able to go back and double check the list of lectures like i can withall my other professors.the midterm felt like a poor representation of our knowledge being demonstratedgreatboth instructors were passionate about what they were teaching and tried their best to deliver the content online. however, therecorded lectures were sometimes very choppy and it was hard to hear what was being discussed at times, which made thelearning process difficult. the instruction in this course was great, but the delivery could use some improvement.decentinstructors were only, reading slides and it was so boring. also they were not able to describe it clearly.the course was fine, but with the switching of profs, it was difficult to keep up with what they wanted to see and what questionswould be on quizzes and assignments. the workload was also a lot which was difficult to balance with my other classes, that hadthe same workload. the lab quizzes don\'t exactly show the intellectual level of the class, since it is being marked automatically bythe computer. these marks definitely did not help the overall class average, adding onto the workload which was hard to keep upwith, causing the class and i to not be able to do the best we can do.it was finei personally believe that the beginning of the course was great, i loved the live sessions, where the class was engaging and theprofessor was asking a lot of questions. however i do have to say that i do not really like asynchronous, as there was some drawintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/7/2020 6/24commentsback in the way that you can\'t ask questions.the teaching was okay and i mostly taught myself through the textbook. :(good course. it would be nice if the exam had the option to go back to previous questions as this relieves the stress of the time limitand allows students to think over questions they may be stuck on.besides some technical difficulties that i can totally understand, it was greatthe lectures were extremely engaging and interesting.this course is so hard to manage and a simple error can drag the entire mark down. our professors are good but the amount ofworkloads and the way the questions and time limit for exams are formatted is so hard to keep up with.this course was easy to understand as the professors explained all the concepts very clearly.the overall quality of the instruction in this course is good.they were helpful in answering any questions.all of the instruction given was clear and any questions i had were answered.the instructors taught the course very well. i hope that the first half of the course can be asynchronous because the capacity for a bbcollaborate courseroom is 500 students so it\'s hard to join the class when there\'s many more students than that.it was engagingthe professors are fine, but the lectures are so hard to keep up with whether it be understanding what is actually being said orcontent\xe2\x80\x93wise. as someone who doesn\'t have a great background in chemistry as it is, it\'s like i\'m teaching myself or i have to findother sources to actually get an understandable explanation of concepts. despite crashing constantly, masteringchem was the onlycomponent that was somewhat engaging.good instruction, i would have liked a little more questions during the lectures to make sure people were following along especiallyin the second module.the class assignments where fair. lab content felt difficultthis was a very fair class.the first half of the course was very well taught. when we switched professors after reading week, i did not like how we had to go toasynchronous just because the new prof could not figure out his technology. if we are doing online school you should have thetechnology at home to support it. it was much less engaging when lectures were pre recorded.the course was pretty hard overall, a big jump from high school. the professors are passionate about teaching and it can be seen.i liked how different interactions were created with each of the professors. such as the small lesson summary, or smallparticipation quizzes embedded in the lectures.good format of course.overall, the quality of instruction in this course was good. that being

understand the class material.i was aware of office hours and the professors have emails on the syllabus if we the students needed to reach out to them. therewere also first year learning groups. there were discussion boards that were supposed to be monitored regularly, but i noticed anumber of questions went unanswered.email, tutorials, office hours, and fsg sessions were helpful.exam should

the post\xe2\x80\x93lab calculations. the and the fsgs were adapted well to fit the needs ofthe students. i like how the lab instructor had her own office hour and updated the notebook module with the feedback of thestudents.office hours and the fsgs were very helpful.the fsg\'s and tutorial sessions were very helpful.i appreciate the office hours, the tutorials and also the tas.the tutorials session by aisha were very helpful and helped me understand new concepts.there was a helpful ta, aisha javed who did tutorials and was the only reason i did okay on the lab component.prof, ta and other faculty members did their very best to respond and clarify any questions which i appreciate tremendously.the fsg\'s were particularly helpful since lectures were deleted. the practice questions in the tutorial were also of great assistance.the professors provided excellent support for learning in this course, by promptly responding to emails and addressing anyconcerns, as well as clarifying concepts.i didn\'t find the first few lab practicals helpful because it was mostly the ta reading off the slides and not really explaining the lab.i would recommend that for labs, an instructional video that covers post lab questions be prepared and uploaded for every lab inthe course to give students a better understanding of what to do as we are learning remotely.i had accommodation allowing me more time.there were office hours.i really liked the assistance, especially from the ta\'s. i think that they were very helpful.never sought supportfsg\xe2\x80\x99s were availablelinh viet is the best ta!good.office hours, emails, tutorials were all very useful! great!i think that there could have been more assistance with the lab quizzes, as they were very difficult. though there were postlabquestion for practice, without the answers, we won\'t have a clue if we\'re doing it correctly or not. and the methods needed to solvethe questions are new to us, so i think the postlab practise questions should be more helpful so we can actually pass the labcomponent.my ta was very passionate and explained the labs well. she answered questions very thoroughly and encouraged participation.n/aalthough i have only interacted with one of the two professors, professor marco, i can surely say that asking for assistance orclarification on some matter through email was very easy to do, and extremely helpful.i really appreciate the fsg sessions. attending sarah nanquil\'s sessions were very helpful. she is very patient, and she makessure that everyone understands the concepts before moving on. i know she will make a great teacher in the future. i hope shefacilitates more study groups.all of the instructors are really helpful, in answering our emails and providing answers during office hours. there are tutorials tohelp our understanding of the course materials which is very helpful.office hours were available and professors answered to emails!having ta\'s is already a

were regularly available. course staff were typically quite responsive to emails.the tutorials were very helpful for me when solving labwork.fsgs were available, but i did not get to attend any due to my workload. i often find myself trying to complete assignments andquizzes more than actually learning the material because of the heavy courseload. i would suggest giving a smaller courseworkload so that students can actually attend fsgs and other supplementary supports to help understand the material.lab tutorials, discussion boards, flr session, office hours, email, coffee sessions.along with each prof\'s office hours, there were also chemists consuming coffee, practicals, and fsg sessions. the ""discussion""board was also really useful to clarify any misunderstandings.discussion section on quercus was open though it appears questions weren\'t answered very often there. weekly lab tutorials werevery helpful to further explain concepts introduced in the labs.office hours were open

discussions on quercus, were available to support my learning in the course.mastering chemistry, chemists consuming coffee sessions, fsgs, professorsassistance was available as needed.fsginstructors should focus on how to explain the topic from the core. if instructors are about to read the slides, it is better to not teach.instead give notes to the students and take exams.the fsg group, office hours, emailing.email and discussion boards were availablefor assistance i would email the professors or ta\'s, or i would be in contact with a friend which is taking the same course in orderto better explain me a certain concept in the case that i do not understand it.there were tutorials that were held that helped so much! the tutorials are were where i learned most of my lab skills!talking to the professor directlyfsg session and assignment in the textbookit was okay but i still find it hard to understandfsg and office hours were very helpful when taking this course.n/an/amy ta did a good job of responding to any questions i had.the lab sessions are great. there is a connection between the content of the labs and our course materials. they interact to helpme gain a deeper understanding.the fsg were helpfulthe best support was the tutorials that helped with lab calculations. getting straight forward or detailed help from tas is like talkingto a wall and discussing anything with peers is looked down upon because online learning and \'cheating\'. the tutorials did helpexplain concepts in a straight forward way. the fsgs may have been more helpful if the schedule was not constantly changingbecause unfortunately students do have other things and classes to attend.it was kind of hard to pay attention online so i just studied by myself.office hour sessions where availableoffice hours, ta presentationsthe time to prepare for labs should be extended. i hope they increase the chance to prepare and work on lab quizzes much moreeasily for future students. i don\'t think it\'s fair to simply have 3 questions for calculations and only giving them full marks when theygot the perfectly accurate answer, students should get marks for working and effort too. the resources for preparation for labcalculations could be better as well.fsg sessions were good support for students along with tutorials which helped to practice with the lab questions.we could email either of the instructors or ask a question during office hours if we had trouble with a concept.responds to email fastthe tutorials were very helpful for labs.introductory chemistry i

as the synchronous lab sessions with my ta. shoutout to monica because she was a wonderful andvery helpful ta.the textbook and masteringchemistry was a great help.practical were great, patricia, our

and office hours were useful.the uploaded past papers and other course material were helpful, as were the revealed answers to the midterm. practicalexperiments seem not to be directly related to course material but would have helped develop wet lab skills.\xe2\x80\x93 extensive office hours by second instructortutorials were more helpful than online lab practicals themselves, since these were focus on basically going through theexperiment and replying to discussion questions that were sometimes unrelated to post lab quizzes and reports. office hours were also very convenient and emails were replied quickly.we need live lessons!we had live lecture course rooms, weekly fsgs, tutorial sessions, as well as coffee interaction sessions.homeworks are well designed to deepen my understanding of the course content.email was availablethe practicals were good. my ta did a great job explaining the labs and some other course content to us. however, i do wish thatthere was maybe more time given to explain what specifics were required from the notebook submissions. a lot of the errors that ipersonally made in terms of file type and submission style could have easily been avoided if the content was elaborated on in moredepth.emails are answered quickly and the professors are very understanding overall great support. office hours were great too. i neverattended the fsg\'s.\xe2\x80\x93 masteringchemofficer hours, fsgsthere were tutorials, office hours, lecture hours (later in the term)and discussion boards. in fact, there was such abundance of helpi think it could have been delivered more efficiently.the mastering chem homework helped to close the gaps and allowed me to practice the skills taught in the lectures. the tashelped me understand the lab but the related calculations were confusing.office hours for each professor was available for me.the professors provided office hours and would respond to emails to answer any remaining questions.the fsgs were really helpful and i found it fun to engage in them. i didn\'t feel forced or obligated to go, but i found that they reallyhelped.i didn\'t reach out at all, but i\'m sure that would\'ve helped.a large majority of my encoding came through the chma fsg\'s and i honestly owe a lot of my success this semester to thosesessions because i was having trouble learning from lecture.have emailed the instructions a few times for clarificationsnone since it is difficult to communicate online for me.i really think mastering chemistry helped me with concepts and calculations. it gave you experience and walked you throughquestions you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to answer, which was excellent.the first lab seems to intimidate students\xcd\xbe it was difficult, and i find little relevance from it. after that the lab became doable.the homework are difficult to track because there are no reminders on quercus, which is a huge disappointment.it\'s also not nice that they delete the lectures after some time (about a month or so).introductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/7/2020 13/24commentshe is nice and patientmastering chemistry helps me to understand more about the

email them with questions.any assistance was helpful during this course.the rubrics for assignments are detailed. ta gives useful help.the chma10 fsg program has been tremendous help! i would attend when i could, but i would also make great use of theworksheets made available to us. they are very helpful! my ta, zhibo wang has been great help in my learning as well. i learned alot in the lab

helpful in the tutorial sessions, providing us withclear problem solving methods for our labs!office hoursi think my ta, zhibo wang, was very good. he was funny, outgoing, open, and explained the concepts to the group\'s satisfaction. iwas able to understand the concepts well through the practical sessions with this ta and the advice he gave was good as well. ialso like the mastering chemistry assignments as they help me practice and understand concepts even further.there wasn\'t any assistance that really supported my learningtutorials, fsg, office hours, email, practical sessions, tas,

the questions were worded on the midterm threw me off greatly.i found the weekly lecture summaries a very good method for active recall. they are also proving to be a good technique for examreview.the assistance was great as the tas and fsg opportunities were very helpful'","b ' the quality of instruction was good and understandablegoodthere are lots of details and examples in the lecture . the course is motivating . the information discussed was often covered in extensive detail . however , this was true mostly for content from high school . newconcepts were often overlooked or "" glossed over , with (little) not explanation leading to a lower understanding of the purpose of thoseconcepts and how to apply those concepts . the first half of the course and part of the second were synchronous . that meant someof the class had to watch the course after the time slot because there was not enough room on bb collaborate . over time , fewerpeople came out to these sessions . when it became asynchronous , classes were inconsistent in length and often would have tobe done in multiple sittings because some lectures went almost half an hour over time . this was discouraging and made attentivelearning difficult . on the other hand , the course was a great review from high school and gave me a greater understanding of thoseconcepts . it was hard to listen to a disembodied voice , but i was able to take extensive notes . the homework was predictable intiming and in nature , making it (neither) not overly difficult (nor) not stressful . unfortunately , i did not inspired by this course . i really wantedto be , but instead i developed a dread that perhaps chemistry was not interesting as i previously thought . i recognize that we arein a pandemic , but a xlittle enthusiasm from the professors would go a long way . for these reasons , i believe the course was good , ut it may be improved . first half of the course felt rushed , however the second half felt xlike the material was well taughti liked the structure of all lectures taught by both professors . i would have preferred additional support for understanding the labquestions/concepts being taught . goodoverall , the quality of instruction was very good and i\ have learned a lot from the lectures and lab sessions . the course was not nicely structured as bioa01 . students were divided into odd and even practical , and the odd practicalstudents had to complete their lab before they actually learned the content in the lecture . it gave an unfair advantage to the evenpractical students . the lectures by professor marco was engaging and interesting with a really difficult midterm . professor xiao\' slectures were fair but dry at times . it is hard to find the important points to review on the test . professor marco was straight to the point i liked his teaching style . due to some technical difficulty professor zhang had to makehis classes asynchronous . his slide were good however they overlapped with a lot of the topics taught in professor marco\' s lectureso it wasn\' t very engaging . unfair lab quizzes . grade dropped from 100 to 60 because i rounded differently throughout the question and ended up being acouple decimal places off . overall , i think the quality of instruction was good . however , i think some concepts could have been elaborated more on , rather thanjust being a summary of the textbook . both halves of the course are being well taught . the professors go xwell into depth about the concepts being taught . the delivery of the course was good , anything that i couldn\' t grasp in class was when the textbook greatly helped . the instruction in this course was well done especially with the transition to online learning . i would have hoped that some parts ofthis course take into consideration that the students are living through a global pandemic and learning online at home . i wouldhope that the workload would not heavy when living through this global pandemic by possibly combing work or findingdifferent ways of assessment for students . the overall instruction of this course was well . however , my main concerns are with the lab component of this class . it was poorlyorganized and stressful and made me hate course in general . the lab manager was cordial at times , yet she was inconsistent withher instructions and email correspondence . the instructions and quizzes were (never) not clear and contained plenty of mistakes , thatrequired the student to consequently email her , only yo get a response weeks later . this interrupts my learning experience and ismy only negative feedback for this course . during the pandemic , my mental health deteriorated and this course labs componentadded on to that . i spent too xmuch time on this component and was always stressed because her questions were (never) not relevant . the course was for the most part well structured . prof zimmer was super helpful and created a comfortable environment to learn . his synchronous sessions with the posted slides were interactive and also gave me a chance to make good friends in this toughonline environment . as with every course , there are technical difficulties which is expected with online learning but i did notappreciate prof zhang deleting the lectures ( after just 2 weeks ) . i rather would have appreciated if the lectures were kept for a monthfor review . i was particularly frustrated to see the lectures deleted and had to rely on fsg\' s for learning . the labs were wellstructured and online labs progressed smoother than expected . here\' s hoping we can set foot to an actual lab next term . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was excellent . i thought the lectures were very excellent quality because theyhelped to address the main concepts from the textbook . the mastering chemistry helped me to practice the concepts learned inlecture . more examples would be helpful . additionally , it was very frustrating that the students in the even practicals oftentimes receivedintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/7/2020 4/24commentscourse material xwell before their due dates as compared to the odd practicals that had (less) not time with the lecture material that wouldgreatly improve the understanding needed to complete lab reports for marks . the course instructors did a good job in delivering the course material . i just didn\' t like that halfway through the course we had tomove our classes to asynchronous due to audio quality . besides that , i think the material was well delivered and explained . the professors did a good job teaching the content in the course . my only recommendation would be to conduct more examples inthe lectures to accurately match questions given as mastering chemistry assignments . nirusha was nice but she wasn\' t helpful when it came to the lab quizzes . when i know i was right i was still not full marks sheeven once told me that i did something really well that i hadn\' t even\xe2\x80\x93handed in . the quizzes weren\' t fair and should be changed . ieven once told nirusha that i had time accommodations and that if i could get them for my lab quizzes she said i have 20 mins and2 attempts and (nothing) not . which is what everyone got . professor marco was amazing . he taught really well and made itinteresting . both of my lecture instructors explained the topics very clearly and included some practice questions into their lectures which ifound very useful . but with the practicals , i found the instructions very vague and unnecessarily complicated and difficult . in myopinion the lectures were of high quality whereas the practicals were not . i thought that the professors and tas were able to explain very difficult concepts and ideas to me very clearly , for the most part . i dofeel that the pace of the course was quite fast compared to other courses . the quality was good and i think the instruction was pretty straight forwardthe professors were nice and taught the material somewhat well . when changed from synchronous to asynchronous it effected mylearning negatively . also making it so lectures get deleted after a week of them being posted is ridiculous . also , making tests andexams so that students can not back at the answers is the worst thing ever ! from lectures being deleted and tests not lettingyou check your answers i feel xlike i\xe2\x80\x99m being punished for having to do school online . the labs are also terrible , watching a youtubevideo then having to hand write my lab manual ( include procedures and tables ) is not fair to students . if i\xe2\x80\x99m not participating in alab hand on i shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hand write a full manual every time . i hope the chem ii is run better . i feel the course content could have been explained better . the professors just rushed through the content with minor explanationsof certain topics such as calculationsthe pace of the lectures is good . there is a good balance between the information taught and time for thinking . the instruction was great , but i felt that my hard work on this course did not well on the midterm \xe2\x80\x93 and there\' s only one \xe2\x80\x93because since this is the first year we are doing online learning , and its the first semester of first year for most students taking thiscourse , the course could have been more understanding and made accommodations until students get better suited to universityand online learning . i really liked the lectures as they were informative and teachers spent a good amount of time explaining the content . all professors are knowledgeable of the course and presented the concepts clearly . however , i wish that all lectures could havebeen live because i feel that i gained more knowledge during live lectures than the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded ones . n/athe overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good , as i was able to understand all the material presented easily , andfelt comfortable enough to ask questions when i needed to . despite the restrictions on interaction due to the pandemic , i felt that thelectures , whether they were synchronous or asynchronous , were very successful at trying to create an in\xe2\x80\x93person atmosphere . all of the instructions on the quercus are well organized and neatly presented . there is a lot of assignments that go with this course , including lab material . mastering chemistry allows us to practice problemswhich allows better understanding . there were times when labs were assigned before the related material was taught , resulting inus having to teach ourselves . lab assignments should also be explained a xlittle more thoroughly , so the presentation of labnotebooks is done so in an ideal way . there should also be a way that students can study for post lab quizzes so they know what toexpect instead of it being a surprise . the tutorials were very helpful . the first professor went a xlittle too xfast at the beginning . he would skip math problems as we did not time left , butthese are the concepts that many students struggle with . the professor did explain the concepts very well . the first half of thecourse could be better if the professor took time explaining the different type sof math questions provided in the lecture . he alsomade use of questions to get students to interact , i found this very helpful ! the second professor was not including engagement , soi was always demotivated . the lectures were hard to follow along as the teaching style was not great . the overall instruction in this course was easy to understandthe audio of this course is not best . and i find prof marco\' s lecture to not engaging . the course was good , instructors were kind and answered questionsi much rather like in\xe2\x80\x93class lectures . in honest options , some lecture sounds are horrible and i lost interest in learning . thus , i knowdelateing lectures videos are keeping engaging yet we all lose a x"" second chance "" to fully understand some complex ideas . the instruction was quite thorough . there was simply a lot of heavy content that had to be covered , making this course moreintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/7/2020 5/24commentsdifficult , but the instruction was still quite thorough . it was a good course overall , but i wish there was more support for labs during the first month and more examples of questions thatmay be in the exam in lectures . the professors taught this course xwell but i often found it very boring . i usually like chemistry and maybe it\' s because i\ have lost allmotivation for school , but i did not find it fun and interesting to learn about this time around . i like how in depth we went into certain topics , and the explanation of the importance of certain topics would be in future chemistrycourses . i absolutely loved this course ! definitely one of my favourites . in high school , i didn\' t really enjoy chemistry that much due to the waythat high school courses are structured but i still found the content intriguing . in this course , in particular , the lab structure ( eventhough it was all online ) was not only quite fun to complete but actually helped me understand the content in a real work application . in terms of lectures , i found prof . marco\' s lectures very clear and easy to follow . the only improvement that i would say is that prof . marco went a xlittle fast sometimes , but i was able to get around it by watching the recorded lectures wherever i thought i needed to . prof zhang\' s lectures were also clear ( aside from the technical problems we were encountering in the beginning ) and at times , retty easy to understand . technical issues for both lecturers impacted instruction somewhat . there was a limit to the amount of students allowed to enter thecourse room ( 500 limit for an 1000 student class ) which greatly impacted the first few lectures \xe2\x80\x93 this should have been worked outbefore the year started . mic problems for both lecturers impacted understanding \xe2\x80\x93 for the second half of the semester , lecturesbegan to be uploaded asynchronously instead of having live lectures as a result . asynchronous lectures naturally limit interactionwith the instructor , though this was partially remediated by having a simultaneously run bb\xe2\x80\x93collaborate room open at the time thelectures would have been held to ask questions . slides used in the lectures were uploaded before classes , concepts wereexplained fairly well . explanation for the expectations for labs were unclear at the beginning as xwell . the professor explained concepts clearly in lecture and offered practice questions for students to better grasp the concept . professor hosted office hours twice per week which was helpful . a bit heavy and way too xfast\xe2\x80\x93paced at times , but otherwise it was good . the course was organized and taught well . the course material was fair , some professors would talk too xfast and sometimes they would not explain what was on theslides . i feel we should of provided more hdespite the challenging situation we are in today , i appreciated all the professors\' hard work for making this course a fantasticlearning experience . even if the course was provided online , it did not hinder the quality of education i received from the professors . i loved professor marco\' s lectures they were nice and it always felt xlike i was constantly engaged . in the second half we had to moveto async so it was tough especially since the concepts were more challenging it was harder to understand . the quality of this course was excellent , the concepts were clearly taught by professors . they were very understanding and verygood at explaining hard topics in a more understanding way . the first part of the course ( prof . m zimmer de\xe2\x80\x93iuliis ) was very well taught and conductive to learning . the second part ( prof . xiao\xe2\x80\x93an zhang ) has been well\xe2\x80\x93taught within the lectures . however , they do not leave the lecture recordings up for more than a weekwhich is stressful because i have to make sure i download them ( per agreement ) before they are taken down and am constantlyworrying that i missed something because i can\xe2\x80\x99t count on being able to go back and double check the list of lectures like i can withall my other professors . the midterm felt xlike a poor representation of our knowledge being demonstratedgreatboth instructors were passionate about what they were teaching and tried their best to deliver the content online . however , therecorded lectures were sometimes very choppy and it was hard to hear what was being discussed at times , which made thelearning process difficult . the instruction in this course was great , but the delivery could use some improvement . decentinstructors were only , reading slides and it was so boring . also they were not able to xdescribe it clearly . the course was fine , but with the switching of profs , it was difficult to keep up with what they wanted to see and what questionswould be on quizzes and assignments . the workload was also a lot which was difficult to balance with my other classes , that hadthe same workload . the lab quizzes don\' t exactly show the intellectual level of the class , since it is being marked automatically bythe computer . these marks definitely did not help the overall class average , adding onto the workload which was hard to keep upwith , causing the class and i to not able to xdo the best we can do . it was finei personally believe that the beginning of the course was great , i loved the live sessions , where the class was engaging and theprofessor was asking a lot of questions . however i do have to say that i do not like asynchronous , as there was some drawintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/7/2020 6/24commentsback in the way that you can\' t ask questions . the teaching was okay ay and i mostly taught myself through the textbook . : ( good course . it would be nice if the exam had the option to go back to previous questions as this relieves the stress of the time limitand allows students to think over questions they may be stuck on . besides some technical difficulties that i can totally understand , it was greatthe lectures were extremely engaging and interesting . this course is so hard to manage and a simple error can drag the entire mark down . our professors are good but the amount ofworkloads and the way the questions and time limit for exams are formatted is so hard to keep up with . this course was easy to understand as the professors explained all the concepts very clearly . the overall quality of the instruction in this course is good . they were helpful in answering any questions . all of the instruction given was clear and any questions i had were answered . the instructors taught the course very well . i hope that the first half of the course can be asynchronous because the capacity for a bbcollaborate courseroom is 500 students so it\' s hard to join the class when there\' s many more students than that . it was engagingthe professors are fine , but the lectures are so hard to keep up with whether it be understanding what is actually being said orcontent\xe2\x80\x93wise . as someone who doesn\' t have a great background in chemistry as it is , it\' s like i\ am teaching myself or i have to findother sources to actually get an understandable explanation of concepts . despite crashing constantly , masteringchem was the onlycomponent that was somewhat engaging . good instruction , i would have liked a xlittle more questions during the lectures to make sure people were following along especiallyin the second module . the class assignments where fair . lab content felt difficultthis was a very fair class . the first half of the course was very well taught . when we switched professors after reading week , i did not like how we had to go toasynchronous just because the new prof could not figure out his technology . if we are doing online school you should have thetechnology at home to support it . it was much (less) not engaging when lectures were pre recorded . the course was pretty hard overall , a big jump from high school . the professors are passionate about teaching and it can be seen . i liked how different interactions were created with each of the professors . such as the small lesson summary , or smallparticipation quizzes embedded in the

15comments8 please comment assistance available support learn course comments,"b'professor sullan was great as she provided practice problems frequently and went over topics to reiterate what she had just taught.her teaching was very clear. professor vozny was not clear at all, sometimes it looked like he was unsure of the material he waspresenting and it was not clear at all.the course instructor\'s were excellent, especially the first half professor voznyy. managed to take a subject i found abhorrent in highschool and make it enjoyable. also appreciated how he focused on the applications of the content and relating them to real lifesituations. also the nilered/blue videos were great.second half was amazing with a prof that ensured comprehension was suffice. ruby made chemistry an extremely enjoyableexperienceinstruction was usually clear.first half of the course was quiet confusing for me. i found it easier to read the textbook rather than studying from lectures slidesbecause it didn\'t help much. he could should have done more examples and questions in class to better prepare for the exam.also, i don\'t think video shown in class was necessary as it didn\'t help reinforce any concept learnt. however, the masteringassignements were useful because the questions were well constructed and helped me better understand. for the seoncd half of the course, i loved how she did a review of each concept learnt on the previous lecture before starting a newone. this was useful as it didn\'t make me forget stuff that i learnt weeks ago. also, she would always make questions relating to thelecture that appeared on previous exams. so far, i find that the way she teaches in great and readings from the textbook wasnecessary only if a concept was not understood properly.prof.sullan was very engaging and thoroughly explained concepts, she taught and then demonstrated with examples. sheanswered questions really well and is a kind person. this instruction was very helpful to my learning. we didn\'t have instructornirusha, no comment in her/his teaching. prof. voznyy was timely in his slack responses, but did not engage the class inconversation as much as i would\'ve liked, nice guy though.i like the way prof ruby taught. she was very clear and slowed down when necessary. prof vonzyy was not clear and it seemed likehe didnt understand some concepts himself so he would rush over those. his exam did not have a fair amount of all content that welearned during his time teaching.professor voznyy was not a very good professor. he seems uninterested in what he teaches, and his slides were copy and pastedstraight from the textbook. in class examples were nothing like the midterm questionsi hope university decides that even though researchers are genius some of them cannot teach that\xe2\x80\x99s why future researchers end upgiving up something that they want,which this case was chemistry for me!the instruction of this course was fair. the professors of this courses did a good job explaining hard questions during class.however, the labs for this semesters were sometimes lacking instructions, so maybe consider revising the lab manual multipletimes so it is clear for the student on what is to occur during the lab.alex vozny should not be teaching this course. dr. sullan explained all her concepts very well with examples. dr. vozny did not goover any examples in class, he only covered concepts which are no help for the exams or online assignments. he should do more""showing"" in terms of examples and less ""telling"". we learn if you show us something especially if its a brand new concept that wehave not learned before. dr vozny\'s classes were only 30 minutes each when they are actually supposed to be 50 minutes inlength. he could have used those extra 20 minutes every day to go over examples like dr. sullan did. dr. alex vozny should not beteaching this course at all. he automatically ""assumes"" most of us know what he is talking about but that is rarely the case. hetalked about buffers and titrations as if we were experts in those. again, very disorganized. he didn\'t even use his clicker properly.for the people on weboption, we couldn\'t even see what he was pointing to on the slides. and majority of the time he spent in classwas going back and forth to different slides. his midterm was really wierd too. it was out of 30 with 20 multiple choice questions butapparently the final mark was out of 20. not only that but the passing mark was 5? how does that work?the overall quality of learning was good in terms of learning and retaining the course material. however, the professors canimprove on their dedication to teach students. the marking scheme of the midterm was unfair and confusing, but the questionswere fair.goodthe overall quality of the instruction in this course was good. although the professors provided thorough lectures presenting classmaterial, i believe that more time provided to examples (going through examples) would help student better\xe2\x80\x93understand concepts.its decent, not too bad, but not of 100% high quality professionhe is very responsible and his teaching is easy to understand\xe3\x80\x82it was welli feel like they should be more engaging towards the students.i found this course very hard to follow. the lectures were not properly taught and the information was conveyed in a very confusingmanner. professor voznyy did not explain the concepts clearly at all. the lectures were rushed and mostly ended in about 30 mins.he skipped slides and did not even teach the calculation questions properly. the mid term was very difficult and the questions onintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/3/2020 4/15commentsthere did not reflect the in class material or the questions that were given to practice. i feel a lot of the time it was very hard to hearwhat he was saying. professor sullan taught the course with a lot more detail and explained the concepts better. i think that the herclass can be more intuitive as at times it feels very boring.the first half of the course was decent but the second half of the course felt a splurge of information being told to me without theproper use of it. the instructor talks way to fast in the lecture. the points and discussion she tries to make in the lectures fails tohelp me with my assignments that she assigns. for the assignments, i\'m better off studying the textbook then even considering herlecture notes which become confusing when trying to review her practice questions. in the assignments, she doesn\'t even providethe sections of the textbook the questions were based off so that students can review these questions from the assignments.the instruction in this course was clear and detailed.the first half of the semester the lectures were not engaging at all, we skipped over a lot of practice problems so i wasnt able tolearn how to do the questions properly. the midterm test was not fair to the kinds of questions we were being asked in class orfrom the fsgs, they were far more advanced even though i thoroughly prepared for the midterm.all instructors are extremely knowledgable about what they are teaching and do a good job of fully explaining themselves andanswering questions where there may be something that is unclear.first module was very boring to listen to, as he just leaned against the podium and read off slides. second module was betterbecause the prof recognized us and made sure we understood.although the content is hard to learn, the instruction made it easier to understandthe course instructors explained all topics clearly during the lectures. they included a lot of practice problems in their lessons,which helped me deepen my understanding of the material. as for the laboratory practicals: the knowledge i gained from the lectures was not always sufficient to help me complete theactivities in my lab notebook, and i often had to go to the chem help center for assistance. i felt that a lot of the material covered inthe labs did not clearly correspond to the lecture material. however, the lab material itself covered relatively simple concepts.it was hard to follow at the beginning (module 1) because most of the questions were calculation\xe2\x80\x93based questions and i feel likethe instructor should be more interactive with the material and the students, for instance, drawing and doing calculations with theclass instead of pictures of calculations that were somewhat confusing. however, overall, every instructor did a good job in ourweekly discussions.very very poor instruction especially from professor voznyy as he did not know what he was doing and did not care about hisprofession.although oleksandr\'s lectures were fairly boring, he was definitely the only instructor in this course that genuinely wanted thestudents to succeed. he often encouraged us to ask questions during lectures and come to his office hours. he openly discussedassignments during the spare time in lectures. he gave a decent indication of what material is testable throughout his lectures andhe organized his lectures schedules to allow for a review session before his midterm, also allowing students to vote on whichtopics they would like him to go over. his midterm was fairly difficult, however he did recognize that many students did poorly andopenly expressed that he did not want or expect students to be unsuccessful and was open to any feedback to improve this forfuture students.in contrast, i cannot say the same for ruby. many upper year students warned me about her being a terrible prof, including many ofmy ta\'s, and i unfortunately cannot say i had a different experience. in lecture, she would present practice questions that were nowhere near the difficulty level of her assignments and exam. she said openly in lecture that her exam is nearly impossible and sheis unsure if she will even provide us with a formula sheet, which is frankly essential considering the content of her portion of thecourse. it is fairly obvious that she does not want students to exceed and takes pride in the fact that her exam is so difficult. as aprofessor, your job is to teach the content and guide the students\' learning to help them be successful in their academic career, notto work hard to discourage and derail them for what they are trying to achieve. nirusha was very similar. she was very unapproachable the entire semester. several students have been contacted by a supposedacademic offence that was committed and nearly all of these students had complained about how it was just an error in theircalculations, but she insists on accusing many students of falsification. i will even go as far as to say she wanted to catchsomeone committing an ""academic offence"" for no reason other than pride and simply to scare students.the professors are very helpful but when it comes to assessments, i do not know who created them, but they can be tricky andsomewhat too heavy compare to the examples the lecture slides or the book provided. i know assessments supposed to challengeour comprehension and knowledge but most of the time i feel helpless, what i mean is that i thought i get the concepts, but whenim at the moment of completing the assessment just like the midterm, i feel like i do not know anything at all. i do not know what idon\'t know. that is what i usually feel after assessments. i was so thankful that administation thought about having chem aid thistime. it\'s just that its too late to know the right answer.quality of instruction was not thorough. i would have very much appreciated if ta\'s were helpful in passing on the necessaryinstructions.the instruction was good.in this class, i can learn some useful knowledge and the instructor is very kind.good quality of instructions although emails were answered lateintroductory chemistry ii

material.goodfsgs, help centrei believe that practice questions similarly to the difficulty to the exam should be provided. many of the questions provided were eithertoo easy (textbook) or too hard (matering\xe2\x80\x93chemistry), i believe that by giving student practice problems with similar difficulty wouldhelp them prepare for the exam.fsg's, office hours.the fsg is helpfullabs and mastering were wellfor mastering chem please put hint as well as the chapter that the problem is based on. also, please don't make take a hugepercentage off a question we get wrong in mastering chemistryboth professors had office hours to go get help. i feel that the chem help center was extremely helpful. the help center allowedme to go every week to get help for in class questions but also for lab difficulties and questions. i think the chem help center isone of the best resources available for chemistry students.the ta's were great help in understanding some concepts.chma11 fsgs were very helpful because it allowed me to see which topics i understood well and which ones i needed morepractice in. the chem\xe2\x80\x93aid centre was also helpful when i had questions about lab content.the fsgs did not relate to the kinds of questions we got on the midterm.the mastering chemistry questions were great to practice and check our understand as well as for preparing for the exams.further, both professor vonzyy and sullan provided multiple practice and example questions throughout their lectures which weremore than sufficient in allowing us to check our understanding of course concepts.prof hours were available for most of the weekhelp was highly accessible and helpful (fsgs, ta, etc.)dr. voznyy and dr. sullan were both very open to questions and i felt comfortable approaching them. furthermore, i also feltcomfortable asking them to implement my in\xe2\x80\x93course disability accommodations. (i am registered with accessability services.)they both agreed to give me advance notice of the lecture readings, which was extremely helpful to me throughout the course.i did not interact much with dr. thavarajah, but she did answer a few questions for me via email. the chem help center was very helpful to me.fsg, chem aidassist from external fsgs was readily available. poor office hours from professors.my ta, keuna, seemed very intimidating at first. however, she was actually very kind, helpful, and encouraging. she conducted thelab practicals in such a way that she did not give students answers, but also did not leave us completely confused, like some of myprevious tas. instead, she guided our thought process and helped us come to conclusions on our own. she was really open togiving us feedback to help us improve on future assessments in chma11 and the rest of our undergraduate degrees. lastly, shewas encouraged us to contact her with any questions and concerns, even after the closure of the university. i feel very fortunate tohave had her as my ta this semester.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/3/2020 6/15commentsthe chem aid center was very helpful.the chem aid. the professors are so helpful and i appreciate their efforts very much. the fsgsfor me, as a student there is something lacking about the process of sinking all of the concepts to my understanding. i do not knowif its only me who feel like this, but i feel like having tutorials aside from having lab experiments will be really helpful. fsg sessionsalways do conflict with my timetables, and i think those sessions are really helpful. fsgs provides us an opportunity to practice, askquestions among our peers, similar to tutorials, then why not make it as an official tutorial and maybe make it as a 5% of our grade.it will also help us be ready with mastering questions. with all due respect, these are only my suggestions, and i thank you forreading them. i really want to help other peers especially i the struggle among us studentsta's in this course did not seem very helpful. i felt like i had to figure everything out myself. the environment did not feel verystudent\xe2\x80\x93friendly. i felt like i was holding back due to the environment.fsgs and the chem aid center were a great help. office hours were also available for help.we have labs every two week, and we also have fsg, we discuss together and learn together.fair assistance""","b ' professor sullan was great as she provided practice problems frequently and went over topics to reiterate

questions we were being asked in class orfrom the fsgs , they were far more advanced even though i thoroughly prepared for the midterm . all instructors are extremely knowledgable about what they are teaching and do a good job of fully explaining themselves andanswering questions where there may be something that is unclear . first module was very boring to listen to , as he just leaned against the podium and read off slides . second module was betterbecause the prof recognized us and made sure we understood . although the content is hard to learn , the instruction made it easier to understandthe course instructors explained all topics clearly during the lectures . they included a lot of practice problems in their lessons , hich helped me deepen my understanding of the material . as for the laboratory practicals : the knowledge i gained from the lectures was not sufficient to help me complete theactivities in my lab notebook , and i often had to go to the chem help center for assistance . i felt that a lot of the material covered inthe labs did not clearly correspond to the lecture material . however , the lab material itself covered relatively simple concepts . it was hard to follow at the beginning ( module 1 ) because most of the questions were calculation\xe2\x80\x93based questions and i feel likethe instructor should be more interactive with the material and the students , for instance , drawing and doing calculations with theclass instead of pictures of calculations that were somewhat confusing . however , overall , every instructor did a good job in ourweekly discussions . very very poor instruction especially from professor voznyy as he did not know what he was doing and did not care about hisprofession . although oleksandr\' s lectures were fairly boring , he was definitely the only instructor in this course that genuinely wanted thestudents to succeed . he often encouraged us to ask questions during lectures and come to his office hours . he openly discussedassignments during the spare time in lectures . he gave a decent indication of what material is testable throughout his lectures andhe organized his lectures schedules to allow for a review session before his midterm , also allowing students to vote on whichtopics they would like him to go over . his midterm was fairly difficult , however he did recognize that many students did poorly andopenly expressed that he did not want or expect students to be unsuccessful and was open to any feedback to improve this forfuture students . in contrast , i can not say the same for ruby . many upper year students warned me about her being a terrible prof , including many ofmy ta\' s , and i unfortunately can not say i had a different experience . in lecture , she would present practice questions that were nowhere near the difficulty level of her assignments and exam . she said openly in lecture that her exam is nearly impossible and sheis unsure if she will even provide us with a formula sheet , which is frankly essential considering the content of her portion of thecourse . it is fairly obvious that she does not want students to exceed and takes pride in the fact that her exam is so difficult . as aprofessor , your job is to teach the content and guide the students\' learning to help them be successful in their academic career , notto work hard to discourage and derail them for what they are trying to achieve . nirusha was very similar . she was very unapproachable the entire semester . several students have been contacted by a supposedacademic offence that was committed and nearly all of these students had complained about how it was just an error in theircalculations , but she insists on accusing many students of falsification . i will even go as far as to say she wanted to catchsomeone committing an "" academic offence "" for (no) not reason other than pride and simply to scare students . the professors are very helpful but when it comes to assessments , i do not know who created them , but they can be tricky andsomewhat too xheavy compare to the examples the lecture slides or the book provided . i know assessments supposed to challengeour comprehension and knowledge but most of the time i feel helpless , what i mean is that i thought i get the concepts , but whenim at the moment of completing the assessment just like the midterm , i feel xlike i do not know anything at all . i do not know what idon\' t know . that is what i usually feel after assessments . i was so thankful that administation thought about having chem aid thistime . it\' s just that its too xlate to know the right answer . quality of instruction was not thorough . i would have very much appreciated if ta\' s were helpful in passing on the necessaryinstructions . the instruction was good . in this class , i can learn some useful knowledge and the instructor is very kind . good quality of instructions although emails were answered

comments,"b'i was given the opportunity to learn in this coursei think prof nirusha is really really nice in person. she is really helpful if you have any inquiries, questions,and would go an extramileexplaining them. i think the peer instruction qs in class are very helpful, i can also ask her qs on the spot. its basically like a practicesession. i also like speed that she covers the material even though i think it is a little slow, but i understand the materials on thespot, i dont have to review the material again to do practice problem from textbook. i also like the way she organized the concept andassessment, they are really clear.i really enjoyed the peer instruction portion of the course, it solidified the information during lecture making it easier to study athome.it was a good class. the peer instruction questions really are helpful, i loved them. prof. thavarajah is clear when she teaches andalways encourages us to do our best and practice.the overall quality of the instruction was excellent. it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to take this course and the professorwas great in terms of teaching the content and making sure that students understand the material thoroughly. the professor wasalso very helpful during office hours in terms of answering questions on the material. professor thavarajah is a fantastic professorwho is dedicated to helping students learn and get the most out of taking the course.nirusha is an amazing professor. other professors should take notes on how she does her lectures because she is able tothoroughly explain concepts and provide practice that enhances the knowledge.best prof ever, very fairi understand that this course is one of the more difficult courses but the professor and tas made it engaging and were easy toreach out too. i wish there was a set rubric that we could follow for our labs as it seemed like each ta had a different markingscheme. additionally, i hope that future students would get a chance to review their tutorial quizzes after they were marked or if thetas could take them up so that students know what mistakes they made.perfect. she\'s clear, takes her time, and is genuinely concerned with whether we\'re comprehending what she teaches.i took this course last semester but i dropped it because i was doing poorly. i was worried about taking it again this semester, butthavarajah took away my worries. she is an amazing teacher, i was able to understand concepts that i had trouble understandingbefore. the pacing of every lecture is great, i am able to follow along. my favourite part of lecture was the peer instruction questions.it\'s a great way of practice and making sure you understood what was taught. it was also good preparation for the exam. i enjoyedthe labs, the lab quizzes were fair. i thought the tutorial quizzes were mostly fair, but i would have liked a few more minutes tocomplete them, perhaps 15 min instead of 10 min. i have struggled with chemistry in the past, but thavarajah was able to make thecontent understandable, and when it made sense it was fun to learn.the overall quality of the instruction was very good. the content of the course was delivered in an effective and engaging manner.the method of instruction (peer instruction questions) were really helpful as it helped provide a better understanding of the coursematerial.this course, organic chemistry, which i used to think dull and hard becomes quite interesting thanks to prof nirusha.professor thavarajah explained the concepts very well. i liked how more time was spent on the harder chapters (towards the end)with more challenging ""peer instruction"" questions. overall, i really enjoyed this course.there was a lot of practice questions done in class which really helped demonstrate the concepts learned.i think it was very helpful to go over the questions in detail during office hours.the professor was very clear in terms of instructions provided through quercus by sending very consistent reminder emails and ithelped people to keep in check of all the deadlines.i have taken this course 4 times before and having nirusha as a professor made a huge difference. she goes through the lecture ata good pace, she also lets students work on problems in class, i think this is very important in consolidating knowledge. in additionshe provides many practice questions to reinforce concepts later on.the instruction was very good, topics are clearly explained and made clear what we needed to know for the exam.the professor was very good at explaining the concept in this course. she would have peer\xe2\x80\x93instruction which helped a lot with myunderstanding as it would make me practice right after i learned the topic. to add on, the professor did not rush any topic, she madesure everyone understood what was happening before moving on. the professor also tried to teach us patterns in organicchemistry instead of memorizing the concepts.always a pleasure having professor thavarajah. her quizzes and exams always based on what we\'ve learned and done in class,very fair, no surprises. informative lectures and very helpful peer instruction segments to make sure the material is beingunderstood.amazing instructor!lots of extra office hours available. the class had many interesting and stimulating peer instruction questions which were veryuseful and helpful for the course and learning process.organic chemistry i chmb41h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/3/2020 4/16commentsprofessor nirusha was an excellent professor for the course. her teaching style and tactics made the course material easier theunderstand and digest. her tutorials made sure we kept up with course material and that we understood the central principles andconcepts.excellentprofessor thavarajah is extremely clear in her teaching, gives very helpful and relevant practice questions (both in and out of class)and is very approachable for help outside of class. lecture material and slides are very clear and well\xe2\x80\x93elaborated on in class.concepts are thoroughly explained.i had heard horror stories about this course and i was so scared coming into it, but after finishing two thirds of the course, i\'mactually looking forward to taking part 2 (especially if the professor is the same). the professor gave so many opportunities tounderstand the concepts and clear up any misunderstandings not only in class, but also in office hours. she was always veryhelpful and never made me feel like i couldn\'t ask her questions. in addition, she went at a perfect pace where it didn\'t seem asthough we were rushing through any concepts and yet were still able to complete the chapters on time. i really feel like theprofessor cared more about us fully understanding the material rather than just trying to hurry through everything on the syllabus.the instruction of the class was well with the many discussion questions. however, in the tutorials there was not much time to askand clear questions as it seemed too rushed. the lab equipment were not at its best condition where some of the equipment keptcoming loose and eventually breaking later on in the lab like the water piping in the fumehood. the labs were very long and we wereonly able to finish by extreme rushing.organic chemistry i chmb41h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/3/2020 5/168. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course.comments'","b""lots of assistance was there to support my learning in class, each classi think she is a really helpful and approachable prof if you have any questions. but i do hope she is more responsive with onlineemails.prof. thavarajah's office hours were great and always busy. she did her best to get to everyones questions in a timely manner eventhough it was tough. my ta, celia, was excellent. she's very smart and knows exactly what she's doing. she was always positive and encouraged usconstantly. amazing ta.i found tutorial worksheets helpful un learningi viewed the lab seminar slides online and found that i would have benefitted a little more if i actually attended the seminars inpersonoffice hours right after lecture \xe2\x80\x93 extremely helpfulthavarajah was available to answer questions any time during class, she has office hours, and you can email her. tas from thetutorial and lab were also available to provide support. there were lab skills seminars which were very helpful.thank you my practical ta amad who helped me so much during experimentpeer instruction questions were very helpful.the tutorials were meant to aid in practice. the prof would always make herself avaible to answer any questionsprofessor's office hours were very helpful in terms of providing people with better understanding of course concepts.nirusha as well as the teaching assistants made themselves available through office hours and emailsthere was a lot of assistance in this course. the professor had many office hours and she always tried to accommodate sometime by giving appointments or by making her office hours longer to make sure everyone can get all the help they need.tas and office hoursn/apractice questions in an out of lectures were extremely helpful, and so were question assignments from the textbook. tutorials alsoenhanced learning. professor thavarajah was extremely accessible for help and to answer questions.my lab ta (syed) was okay. he was very friendly and helpful but he got confused easily which lead to me being confused as well.this was in part, i believe, due to the fact that some of the instruction in the lab manual was so confusing and i don't blame him forthat. however, he sometimes gave bad advice to me and my partner on information that i feel he should've already known. the lab manual was very confusing and resulted in me and my partner extremely messing up one of our labs because theprocedure in the manual was not chronological. in addition, it was very difficult, messy and confusing to have to put certain parts ofthe pre\xe2\x80\x93 and post\xe2\x80\x93lab on specific pages. also, there was one lab where me and my partner was supposed to do the entire labtogether but in one notebook. this doesn't make much sense as we both need the information. the tutorial tas (daniel and rebecca) were not very helpful as they never actually helped to clear up any questions and they didn'tseem very knowledgeable about the subject. they just gave us the worksheet/quizzes and then marked them. i never actuallylearned anything in the tutorials. i found rebecca more helpful than daniel because at least she tried to explain some things whiledaniel would give us a 'hint' and then tell us that he'll leave the rest to us even though we didn't know what to do.""","b ' i was given the opportunity to learn in this coursei think prof nirusha is really really nice in person . she is really helpful if you have any inquiries , questions , nd would go an extramileexplaining them . i think the peer instruction qs in class are very helpful , i can also ask her qs on the spot . its basically xlike a practicesession . i also like speed that she covers the material even though i think it is a xlittle slow , but i understand the materials on thespot , i dont have to review the material again to do practice problem from textbook . i also like the way she organized the concept andassessment , they are really clear . i really enjoyed the peer instruction portion of the course , it solidified the information during lecture making it easier to study athome . it was a good class . the peer instruction questions really are helpful , i loved them . prof . thavarajah is clear when she teaches andalways encourages us to do our best and practice . the overall quality of the instruction was excellent . it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to take this course and the professorwas great in terms of teaching the content and making sure that students understand the material thoroughly . the professor wasalso very helpful during office hours in terms of answering questions on the material . professor thavarajah is a fantastic professorwho is dedicated to helping students learn and get the most out of taking the course . nirusha is an amazing professor . other professors should take notes on how she does her lectures because she is able tothoroughly explain concepts and provide practice that enhances the knowledge . best prof ever , very fairi understand that this course is one of the more difficult courses but the professor and tas made it engaging and were easy toreach out xtoo . i wish there was a set rubric that we could follow for our labs as it seem xlike each ta had a different markingscheme . additionally , i hope that future students would get a chance to review their tutorial quizzes after they were marked or if thetas could take them up so that students know what mistakes they made . perfect . she\' s clear , takes her time , and is genuinely concerned with whether we\ are comprehending what she teaches . i took this course last semester but i dropped it because i was doing poorly . i was worried about taking it again this semester , butthavarajah took away my worries . she is an amazing teacher , i was able to understand concepts that i had trouble understandingbefore . the pacing of every lecture is great , i am able to follow along . my favourite part of lecture was the peer instruction questions . it\' s a great way of practice and making sure you understood what was taught . it was also good preparation for the exam . i enjoyedthe labs , the lab quizzes were fair . i thought the tutorial quizzes were mostly fair , but i would have liked a few more minutes tocomplete them , perhaps 15 min instead of 10 min . i have struggled with chemistry in the past , but thavarajah was able to make thecontent understandable , and when it made sense it was fun to learn . the overall quality of the instruction was very good . the content of the course was delivered in an effective and engaging manner . the method of instruction ( peer instruction questions ) were really helpful as it helped provide a better understanding of the coursematerial . this course , organic chemistry , which i used to think dull and hard becomes quite interesting thanks to prof nirusha . professor thavarajah explained the concepts very well . i liked how more time was spent on the harder chapters ( towards the end ) with more challenging "" peer instruction "" questions . overall , i really enjoyed this course . there was a lot of practice questions done in class which really helped demonstrate the concepts learned . i think it was very helpful to go over the questions in detail during office hours . the professor was very clear in terms of instructions provided through quercus by sending very consistent reminder emails and ithelped people to keep in check of all the deadlines . i have taken this course 4 times before and having nirusha as a professor made a huge difference . she goes through the lecture ata good pace , she also lets students work on problems in class , i think this is very important in consolidating knowledge . in additionshe provides many practice questions to reinforce concepts later on . the instruction was very good , topics are clearly explained and made clear what we needed to know for the exam . the professor was very good at explaining the concept in this course . she would have peer\xe2\x80\x93instruction which helped a lot with myunderstanding as it would make me practice right after i learned the topic . to add on , the professor did not rush any topic , she madesure everyone understood what was happening before moving on . the professor also tried to teach us patterns in organicchemistry instead of memorizing the concepts . always a pleasure having professor thavarajah . her quizzes and exams always based on what we\ have learned and done in class , ery fair , (no) not surprises . informative lectures and very helpful peer instruction segments to make sure the material is beingunderstood . amazing instructor ! lots of extra office hours available . the class had many interesting and stimulating peer instruction questions which were veryuseful and helpful for the course and learning process . organic chemistry i chmb41h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/3/2020 4/16commentsprofessor nirusha was an excellent professor for the course . her teaching style and tactics made the course material easier theunderstand and digest . her tutorials made sure we kept up with course material and that we understood the central principles andconcepts . excellentprofessor thavarajah is extremely clear in her teaching , gives very helpful and relevant practice questions ( both in and out of class ) and is very approachable for help outside of class . lecture material and slides are very clear and well\xe2\x80\x93elaborated on in class . concepts are thoroughly explained . i had heard horror stories about this course and i was so scared coming into it , but after finishing two thirds of the course , i\' mactually looking forward to taking part 2 ( especially if the professor is the same ) . the professor gave so many opportunities tounderstand the concepts and clear up any misunderstandings not only in class , but also in office hours . she was always veryhelpful and (never) not made me feel xlike i couldn\' t ask her questions . in addition , she went at a perfect pace where it didn\' t seem asthough we were rushing through any concepts and yet were still able to complete the chapters on time . i really feel xlike theprofessor cared more about us fully understanding the material rather than just trying to hurry through everything on the syllabus . the instruction of the class was well with the many discussion questions . however , in the tutorials there was not time to askand clear questions as it seemed too xrushed . the lab equipment were not its best condition where some of the equipment keptcoming

however, for professor zhang\'s section of the course, some of the readings suggestedin the syllabus did not fully cover the content discussed in the lectures (especially true for chapter 11 and 19).

helped me in my earning experience.i thoroughly enjoyed this course not only because i love chemistry, but also because the instructors made it so engaging andinteresting. the lectures were delivered in 2 formats \xe2\x80\x93 live in the first half of the semester, and recorded for the second half, but ienjoyed both methods of lecture delivery. the instructors made the course content engaging to follow and helped me learn moreabout chemistry. the labs, though virtual, were also well\xe2\x80\x93designed and easy to follow and gave an idea of what to expect in the labonce we return to in\xe2\x80\x93person classes and labs. i thoroughly enjoyed the writing assignment as it gave me an opportunity to explore atopic within chemistry, and do my own research as well as provide feedback to my peers. this helped me develop skills that i canuse later on in my undergraduate courses in scientific report writing. overall, i really enjoyed this course as it has a high quality ofinstruction, and would definitely recommend this course to other students!under the current circumstances (covid), i think both the live lectures and recorded videos were a good option.instruction was clear and helpful, if they weren\'t we had many chances near the end of the lecture or during office hours to getclarification.the first professor in this course did not make the atmosphere enjoyable for learning at all and made concepts difficult tounderstand. i considered dropping this class but unfortunately i needed it for my major going forward. the writing activity didn\'tcontribute to my understanding of chemistry at all and felt completely irrelevant. the second professor was much better atintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-2021-12-06 5/20commentsexplaining concepts but the hour\xe2\x80\x93long lectures were difficult to stay engaged with. the tests only being 20 questions each make itdifficult to obtain grades that reflect my overall understanding of the material. i had a poor experience with this course unfortunately. ihave been consistently stressed due to this course as well as the upcoming final exam.i really liked when the course was synchronous as we were able to genuinely interact and ask questions surrounding lecturematerial. some of the information is new so it can be presented in a way that is a little confusing, but overall i feel like i waspresented good information in our time together.the content was easily comprehensible, however, some lectures were very filled with content with not a lot of room for explanation.some lectures were also not very engaging.very specific and understandablei think the live lectures were more conducive to my understanding of the content more than the asynchronous lectures.it was great.i really enjoyed the overall quality of the instruction in this course particulary professor marco\'s section because i enjoyed histeaching method and the way he relayed the course content to the students.for the synchronous lectures, during module 1, i was very clear about what i was learning and didn\'t have much difficulty. however,with module 2, i felt that the shift to asynchronous learned really impacted how i was learning the material. i felt like the informationthat was presented went in one ear and out the other, making it very difficult to understand.very detailed and step\xe2\x80\x93by\xe2\x80\x93step instructions were provided throughout the course which really helped me follow throughassignments, lectures, labs and etc. the overall quality of instructions we\'re greatthe instruction quality i feel was higher in the first half of the course than in the second half\xe2\x80\x93 i seemed to be a lot more confusedabout the concepts and struggled more with understanding the longer lecturesthe instructions in this course was fairly straightforward.minimal enthusiasm towards content coming from instructors most of the time.i felt this course to be very content heavy, and things seem to move way too fast. i understand that this is the pace of university but forstudents who just got here, it made it very difficult to succeed in this course. all professors were pretty good and explained thingswell, it was just really hard to take in all this information and be able to understand it well as many of the question were moreapplication based.the lectures were easy to understand the profs would explain further if we had any queries.the several practice problems implemented in each slide deck were incredibly beneficial to my learning. i also enjoyed theparticipolls in the first half. these polls and their discussions helped me identify common mistakes made by other students (or insome cases, myself), which i would then take note of, so that i do not make those mistakes myself.moreover, the review at the beginning of the lectures were greatly appreciated.finally, the weekly updates ""insights into chemistry"" were interesting in the sense that it provided insight in what a career inchemistry may look like.sometimes the material on the lectures was explained in an overly complex way, but the professors explained it well most of thetime.overall the instructions in this course were easy and understandable.good.overall quality of the instruction in this course was thoroughly explained.i liked when the lectures were synchronized, so the lectures were easy to follow. i really liked annotation as my style of learning.slides were constructed well.i found that the switch in professors went a lot smoother than i expected. i understood the teaching of both professors and reallyappreciated their pacing and their explanation. they were both equally engaging in class, although the first prof did go a little fast,the fact that the lectures were recorded were a great help.wish the pace of the course could be slower as it was hard to catch upgood\xef\xbc\x81the instructions were given very clearly and videos were sometimes provided.the lectures at first were a little fast, but that was to get enough material possible in the hour that we had. the essay that we did atthe beginning of the year didn\xe2\x80\x99t really affect me, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense how the strict deadlines were constantly pushed back forthose who did their essay last minute. it was unfair to those and myself who did it on time without the extension. i did enjoy theclutch assignments because it helped me understand the topic a lot better. it provided a video after every question to show how todo it and why the answer is correct or wrong.i believe that the overall quality of the instruction in this course is fair. this is because most of the concepts are easy to understand.though i wished that the recordings would come with captions or a readable transcript.introductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-2021-12-06 6/20commentsthe ta of my practical section\xe2\x80\x93 stephen ho, was really hard to understand and i never understood anything during labs, neverlearned anything for his way of speaking. wish he would put a bit more effort on speaking in a clearer way. he pronounced most ofthe things wrong so i couldn\'t have a grasp on what he was teaching. his slides weren\'t much helpful either.this course was enjoyable, sometimes it felt rushed but i feel like i was able to learn alot. the labs were lot\'s of fun!overall this course contains a lot of complicated concepts and terms\xcd\xbe however, the professor explains them thoroughly and thus aresuper helpful in terms of understanding. the materials are detailed and well explained.professor marco was the only professor i had this semester that provided online, synchronous classes which was excellent aspeople could ask questions and we did practice problems together. the other professors were great in their lectures as well andare pretty detailed in their explanations. they give plenty of real life examples and applications which makes it easier to understandoverall, i was very well supported in my learning experience by professor marco. as someone who was taking chemistry as anelective out of pure interest in learning more, prof. marco was always approachable via email and during office hours + chemistsconsuming coffee sessions. professor marco\'s lectures were very interesting and kept me very well engaged. professor zhang was also approachable and held office hours regularly etc. however, i did not feel very intellectually stimulatedduring his lectures. i am not sure if it is because of the content. i felt the lectures were monotonous and sometimes overlycomplicated concepts that could have been explained in a much simpler way to an intro. to chem class. i say this because when isought help from a friend who had a better background in chemistry than i did, they were able to adequately and simply explainthese concepts to me, without some of the extra information which added to the confusion during lectures. overall, i do thinkstudents could benefit from more engaging and less complicated lectures during the second half of the course.i think macro\'s tutoring speed is too fast, especially at the beginning of the course. it would be better if the content could beexplained more concisely and give more examples.the midterms were unnecessarily difficult.the change from one prof to another was most definitely jarring, as the starting lectures seemed info light, and very much exampleheavy, while xiao\xe2\x80\x93an posted essentially a dubbed over slideshow of bricks of text. extreme opposite style as this was all info,maybe a diagram to solidify understanding. i did worse on the latter portion, but feel i learned more.i had difficulty following along with lectures at times, and the organization and categorization of lectures were difficult to navigate. idon\'t really feel that this is an issue with the instructors, more so a symptom of online learning.lectures were deliberated in an unorganized fashion, from switching to synchronously to asynchronously. furthermore, theexpectations of the workload were quite chaotic.this course had helped me understand the importance of time management. the essay assignment was one of the bestintellectually stimulating assignments this semester with fair grading and good feedback by the ta.the professors have quite different class atmosphere, but both encouraging participation of students, and both delivering thelectures with dedications. i do like how the professors connect the course wisely with history of chemistry, chemistry in real life, andpractices with the contents of the delivery, because they do help me gain more knowledge and enhance my understanding of thecourse.high qualitywith all respect, professor xiaoan zhang\'s accent is pretty thick, so it was often hard to understand him, which made meconcentrate less on his lectures.concepts could have been explained betterthe class has lot of material but even then, the professors go at the students pace. most of the time, the concepts were taught indepth and with examples that we understand. when people asked questions, the profs were eager to help :)very good quality.'","b""no more advicetas (vincent moxley\xe2\x80\x93pacquette) extremely helpfulthe

well and improved my knowledge significantly. clutch, office hoursand tutorials all played a huge role in improving my knowledge. though this may seem like a lot of work to other students, the videolessons can be mandatory or there can be some sort of rule where if someone does the video lesson the weight factor ofsomething else can be less. i say this because the clutch video lessons also really improved my knowledge and made the contenteasier to understand. i strongly believe that other students would benefit greatly from using the video lessons. finally, they providedus with extensions but sometimes this was provided on the day of the deadline or after so it would have been useful if theyannounced it a little earlier.there were office hours, facilitated study groups, online classes and tutorials where students could ask questions about conceptsthat we have learned or ask questions about assigned homework.it would have been better if they elaborated on previous

me in my earning experience . i thoroughly enjoyed this course not only because i love chemistry , but also because the instructors made it so engaging andinteresting . the lectures were delivered in 2 formats \xe2\x80\x93 live in the first half of the semester , and recorded for the second half , but ienjoyed both methods of lecture delivery . the instructors made the course content engaging to follow and helped me learn moreabout chemistry . the labs , though virtual , were also well\xe2\x80\x93designed and easy to follow and gave an idea of what to expect in the labonce we return to in\xe2\x80\x93person classes and labs . i thoroughly enjoyed the writing assignment as it gave me an opportunity to explore atopic within chemistry , and do my own research as xwell as provide feedback to my peers . this helped me develop skills that i canuse later on in my undergraduate courses in scientific report writing . overall , i really enjoyed this course as it has a high quality ofinstruction , and would definitely recommend this course to other students ! under the current circumstances ( covid ) , i think both the live lectures and recorded videos were a good option . instruction was clear and helpful , if they weren\' t we had many chances near the end of the lecture or during office hours to getclarification . the first professor in this course did not atmosphere enjoyable for learning at all and made concepts difficult tounderstand . i considered dropping this class but unfortunately i needed it for my major going forward . the writing activity didn\' tcontribute to my understanding of chemistry at all and felt completely irrelevant . the second professor was much better atintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 2021 - 12 - 06 5/20commentsexplaining concepts but the hour\xe2\x80\x93long lectures were difficult to stay engaged with . the tests only being 20 questions each make itdifficult to obtain grades that reflect my overall understanding of the material . i had a poor experience with this course unfortunately . ihave been consistently stressed due to this course as xwell as the upcoming final exam . i really liked when the course was synchronous as we were able to genuinely interact and ask questions surrounding lecturematerial . some of the information is new so it can be presented in a way that is a xlittle confusing , but overall i feel xlike i waspresented good information in our time together . the content was easily comprehensible , however , some lectures were very filled with content with not lot of room for explanation . some lectures were also not engaging . very specific and understandablei think the live lectures were more conducive to my understanding of the content more than the asynchronous lectures . it was great . i really enjoyed the overall quality of the instruction in this course particulary professor marco\' s section because i enjoyed histeaching method and the way he relayed the course content to the students . for the synchronous lectures , during module 1 , i was very clear about what i was learning and didn\' t have much difficulty . however , ith module 2 , i felt that the shift to asynchronous learned really impacted how i was learning the material . i felt xlike the informationthat was presented went in one ear and out the other , making it very difficult to understand . very detailed and step\xe2\x80\x93by\xe2\x80\x93step instructions were provided throughout the course which really helped me follow throughassignments , lectures , labs and etc . the overall quality of instructions we\ are greatthe instruction quality i feel was higher in the first half of the course than in the second half\xe2\x80\x93 i seemed to be a lot more confusedabout the concepts and struggled more with understanding the longer lecturesthe instructions in this course was fairly straightforward . minimal enthusiasm towards content coming from instructors most of the time . i felt this course to be very content heavy , and things seem to move way too xfast . i understand that this is the pace of university but forstudents who just got here , it made it very difficult to succeed in this course . all professors were pretty good and explained thingswell , it was just really hard to take in all this information and be able to understand it well as many of the question were moreapplication based . the lectures were easy to understand the profs would explain further if we had any queries . the several practice problems implemented in each slide deck were incredibly beneficial to my learning . i also enjoyed theparticipolls in the first half . these polls and their discussions helped me identify common mistakes made by other students ( or insome cases , myself ) , which i would then take note of , so that i do not those mistakes myself . moreover , the review at the beginning of the lectures were greatly appreciated . finally , the weekly updates "" insights into chemistry "" were interesting in the xsense that it provided insight in what a career inchemistry may look xlike . sometimes the material on the lectures was explained in an overly complex way , but the professors explained it well most of thetime . overall the instructions in this course were easy and understandable . good . overall quality of the instruction in this course was thoroughly explained . i liked when the lectures were synchronized , so the lectures were easy to follow . i really liked annotation as my style of learning . slides were constructed well . i found that the switch in professors went a lot smoother than i expected . i understood the teaching of both professors and reallyappreciated their pacing and their explanation . they were both equally engaging in class , although the first prof did go a xlittle fast , he fact that the lectures were recorded were a great help . wish the pace of the course could be slower as it was hard to catch upgood\xef\xbc\x81the instructions were given very clearly and videos were sometimes provided . the lectures at first were a xlittle fast , but that was to get enough material possible in the hour that we had . the essay that we did atthe beginning of the year didn\xe2\x80\x99t really affect me , it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense how the strict deadlines were constantly pushed back forthose who did their essay last minute . it was unfair to those and myself who did it on time (without) not extension . i did enjoy theclutch assignments because it helped me understand the topic a lot better . it provided a video after every question to show how todo it and why the answer is correct or wrong . i believe that the overall quality of the instruction in this course is fair . this is because most of the concepts are easy to understand . though i wished that the recordings would come with captions or a readable transcript . introductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 2021 - 12 - 06 6/20commentsthe ta of my practical section\xe2\x80\x93 stephen ho , was really hard to understand and i (never) not understood anything during labs , neverlearned anything for his way of speaking . wish he would put a bit more effort on speaking in a clearer way . he pronounced most ofthe things wrong so i couldn\' t have a grasp on what he was teaching . his slides weren\' t much helpful either . this course was enjoyable , sometimes it felt rushed but i feel xlike i was able to learn alot . the labs were lot\' s of fun ! overall this course contains a lot of complicated concepts and terms\xcd\xbe however , the professor explains them thoroughly and thus aresuper helpful in terms of understanding . the materials are detailed and well explained . professor marco was the only professor i had this semester that provided online , synchronous classes which was excellent aspeople could ask questions and we did practice problems together . the other professors were great in their lectures as xwell andare pretty detailed in their explanations . they give plenty of real life examples and applications which makes it easier to understandoverall , i was very well supported in my learning experience by professor marco . as someone who was taking chemistry as anelective out of pure interest in learning more , prof . marco was always approachable via email and during office hours + chemistsconsuming coffee sessions . professor marco\' s lectures were very interesting and kept me very well engaged . professor zhang was also approachable and held office hours regularly etc . however , i did not intellectually stimulatedduring his lectures . i am not sure if it is because of the content . i felt the lectures were monotonous and sometimes overlycomplicated concepts that could have been explained in a much simpler way to an intro . to chem class . i say this because when isought help from a friend who had a better background in chemistry than i did , they were able to adequately and simply explainthese concepts to me , (without) not some of the extra information which added to the confusion during lectures . overall , i do thinkstudents could benefit from more engaging and (less) not complicated lectures during the second half of the course . i think macro\' s tutoring speed is too xfast , especially at the beginning of the course . it would be better if the content could beexplained more concisely and give more examples . the midterms were unnecessarily difficult . the change from one prof to another was most definitely jarring , as the starting lectures seemed info light , and very much exampleheavy , while xiao\xe2\x80\x93an posted essentially a dubbed over slideshow of bricks of text . extreme opposite style as this was all info , aybe a diagram to solidify understanding . i did worse on the latter portion , but feel i learned more . i had difficulty following along with lectures at times , and the organization and categorization of lectures were difficult to navigate . idon\' t really feel that this is an issue with the instructors , more so a symptom of online learning . lectures were deliberated in an unorganized fashion , from switching to synchronously to asynchronously . furthermore , theexpectations of the workload were quite chaotic . this course had helped me understand the importance of time management . the essay assignment was one of the bestintellectually stimulating assignments this semester with fair grading and good feedback by the ta . the professors have quite different class atmosphere , but both encouraging participation of students , and both delivering thelectures with dedications . i do like how the professors connect the course wisely with history of chemistry , chemistry in real life , andpractices with the contents of the delivery , because they do help me gain more knowledge and enhance my understanding of thecourse . high qualitywith all respect , professor xiaoan zhang\' s accent is pretty thick , so it was often hard to understand him , which made meconcentrate (less) not his lectures . concepts could have been explained betterthe class has lot of material but even then , the professors go at the students pace . most of the time , the concepts were taught indepth and with examples that we understand . when people asked questions , the profs were eager to help : ) very good quality .

lecture withus pretty good8 please comment assistance available support learn course comment,"b""goodvery responsible professors, very useful online experiment applications, very delicate ppt made.the first instructor was okay. while he started out teaching well, you could tell that later, his teachings got simple and boring. notonly were concepts not explained very well, but he even said on a couple of occasions that he himself had to google the solution orhe didn't know what to do. not really great for confidence. when explaining how to solve problems, he would provided a basicexplanation but wouldn't really explain what he was doing. the second instructor provides clear lecture slides, practice problems with clear solutions, and generally explains topic very verywell. she speaks clearly, easily, and provides lots of examples and problems with easy to follow solutions. the ta's also did a nice job explaining topics and how to solve problems.the course is vastly good, i thank prof voszy for the bonus question that gave us a chance to boost our midterm grade. for thesecond half, the prof inbeded question within the lectures further enhances understanding of the material.the lectures in the second half were rather hard to follow and understand at times, especially in the topic of chemical kinetics.the professors and the lab coordinator were very helpful with any concerns and questions.throughout the semester, it was evident that all the professors deeply cared about their students and wanted to ensure thesuccess of each and every individual. professor voznyy implemented pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures as well as live q&a sessions, where hewould go over most of the lecture material again while opening the floor for questions. this allowed students to really understandeach concept as it would be repeated in different formats multiple times. professor sullan also used the same format, except anupper year student lead the q&a session. in my opinion it would have been a little more helpful if she had followed the same formatas the previous professor and attended the live sessions herself, but nonetheless the lectures themselves gave ample opportunityfor students to learn the material and see how calculation problems would be done. lastly professor nirusha made the labs veryeasy to follow and engaging, despite the barriers of online learning.first half was a bit harder to understand, but prof was honestly great. i found that the lab portion this semester was really fair! itreally improved my understanding of the concept and it was good for the whole online situation.noi thought that dr. vozny really put a lot of effort and time into his module. he would offer so much supports in order for us to learnbetter. he would do many practice problems that are actually very applicable to questions asked in homework or exams. he hadrecorded lectures and had live lectures to go over tricky problems. i can definitely tell he cared about his students learning conceptsand it showed in his teaching efforts.dr. thavarajah was good, she included labsters to the labs this term which was much better than just giving the results for the laband doing the notebook. this way students can actually see what equipment and techniques are used in the lab.dr. sullan is not bad. has recorded lectures and the ta timbila does live lectures, he is pretty good as well.greatthe professor did not explain the concept well in my opinion. especially with voznyy, i felt like he was not explaining the conceptsand his practice questions that he was solving.the labs were enjoyable. the lecture content was more or less what anyone would expect from intro chemistry.compared to last semester, this semester was so much better. everything was so well put together and organized. the workloadwas much more fair and easier to deal with as well.this course was interesting to learn about. each teacher had a different method of teaching and that made things mostly easy tounderstand and follow.goodit was okay. there were a lot of opportunities to get marks which were good but there were a lot of problems with the lab. thereshould have been more time to do the labsters and we shouldn't have had to do the notebooks. the powerpoints have sufficientinformation .i would like to highlight professor voznyy's effort in making this online course as interactive and as smooth as possible. he hasgone beyond what is expected (eg. adding interactive live lecture sessions, providing access to clutchprep, recording extra problemsets and solutions, making test stats transparent, writing fair tests, making his expectations clear)and has really listened to ourconcerns to make improvement/adjustment in his teaching style. a very humble person with a great passion to teach! while iunderstand each professor may have a different teaching style, i believe our experience of virtual learning and the quality of thiscourse (and other online courses) would greatly improve if every faculty member has put in this much dedication and effort indelivering education.the instructors were really good at explaining the concepts. however, the format of the first half of the course included toom manydifferent videos to watch for one lecture and i found that inconvenient (in terms of time). i really like that we have practise questionsbecause it makes it easier to do the mastering homework questions.yepintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/12/2021 4/15commentsoverall, this course was very straightforward from the beginning. prof. voznyy was very clear with his expectations and what shouldbe done to study. however, his in\xe2\x80\x93class questions were a lot easier than what was on the exam which threw me off a bit, but hisreview slides at the end helped a great deal. prof. sullan explains things well. the mastering chemistry questions providedsometimes require out\xe2\x80\x93of\xe2\x80\x93the\xe2\x80\x93box thinking, but it helps to understand the concepts. she also accommodated when masteringchemistry was not working properly which is amazing.the instruction was alright. sometimes the accent made things difficult to understand, but it turned out to be fine after getting usedto it.overall, the teaching team was great. both professor voznyy and sullan have given us enough care in this course.the lecture slides are point form, which is not clear at all what the topic is talking about. the instruction and elaboration on topicwere poor.professors voznyy and sullan are able to explain concepts clearly in lecture while giving useful pointers on avoiding commonmistakes when solving problems. i especially like how professor sullan makes occasional remarks that tie the theory we learn inclass to real\xe2\x80\x93life examples. more professors should give concrete examples of the theory they are teaching.furthermore, the lectures were of appropriate length and had a decent balance between theory and example.both modules were taught amazingly well, i can really tell that the professors care about what they are talking about and genuinelywant us to do well. i was worried that it would feel disconnected due to this being a first year course with so many students, but inever felt like my professors didn't care. especially professor voznyy, he cared a lot about our success, and it made me want tosucceed even more.greatoverall is great.nice instructors, great slidesall the instructors were amazing! they were all extremely dedicated to ensuring that all the students understood the material well.the instruction was clear and concise.professor alex voznyy did a great job. he was one of the best instructors that i have ever had. he was very responsible and caring.he always responded to emails in less than 24 hours and showed so much interest.however, i did not like the second half of the semester. professor ruby teaches really fast and she does not respond to emails. ionce had a problem with my mastering chemistry and she completely ignored my email. same thing happened to one of myfriends.professor voznyy is a gem! he was literally the best possible person to teach this course and especially more so during thepandemic.the lectures were interesting and it was good that there were prerecorded ones and live components.the first part is significantly easier than the second one. however, we spent similiar time in both parts. in the first part, a recordingends in less than 40 mins a lot and we still feel free about that\xcd\xbe but the second half, the recording usually take the full hour and westill feel kind of overwhelmed.prof voznyy, was caring, passionate and thought in a way where everybody can understand the conceptsprof sullan, also caring but concepts are sometimes hard to understand from hermeetings before given lab assignment, allowing for us to prepare beforehand on what to expect. instructions provided onassignment descriptions and rubrics were also clear and easy to followprofessor voznyy truly helped to ensure we understood the course material well.i like the way lecture slides are organized to help students focus on important concepts.the course was presented quite well. i enjoyed the number of practice questions within the lectures as they were very goodapplications of the lecture content and were great indicators on whether i needed further review of a particular topic.the overall quality of the instruction in this course is really nice. professors alex voznyy and ruby sullan are very knowledgeableand are great lecturers. although they have different styles of teaching, they both incorporate many practice questions in theirlectures and other practice questions \xe2\x80\x93outside of lecture\xe2\x80\x93 to ensure we get the maximum amount of practice needed for thiscourse. to add, professor voznyy relates well with his students and is very understanding.professor vonzyy was very helpful outside of his office hours, and we could reach him at any time with questions and he wouldanswer in a short amount of time. professor sullivan's lectures were very helpful in that there was a review at the beginning of thelecture. i wished that mastering was assigned after all the materials for a chapter was learned for the second half of the course andthat the questions in mastering, i feel, was much more difficult than the questions shown during lectures for the second half of thetermthis course provided everything having to do with assignments on time and was good in allowing us to finish these assignments.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/12/2021 5/15commentsthe quality of instruction is exceptional in this course, especially through the recorded lectures. i have been able to freely take notes,watch lectures, read lectures and complete mastering chemistry assignments with the resources available to me.i found some instructions in this course a bit complex, but it may just be because i struggle in chemistry as it is. overall though,instructions were well\xe2\x80\x93delivered.professor voznyy is to date one of the best professors i have encountered. he tailored the course to the conveniences of thestudents. professor sullan is also a good lecturer in her own right and i really like all the practice problems she does in lecture withus.pretty good8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course.comments""","b'goodemails with professors, asking questions in class, and etc.they answered emails and responded to posts in discussion boards. the office hours were at ideal times and it generally seemedlike they wanted to help us when we asked for it.mastering is awful at teaching us questions. the ""hints"" features is a nice touch that gives us a step by step guild but often mostquestion do not have this feature and in my case, stuck at the question and have to guess the answer. it also often have no orsimplify explaination that we can not learn our mistake from.the ta made the labs flow smoothly and answered any questions we had excellently.in this course, there was ample assistance provided to support students in their learning, such as the dual format of pre\xe2\x80\x93recordedlectures and live q&a sessions alongside the sample problems that would be posted at

midterm grade . for thesecond half , the prof inbeded question within the lectures further enhances understanding of the material . the lectures in the second half were rather hard to follow and understand at times , especially in the topic of chemical kinetics . the professors and the lab coordinator were very helpful with any concerns and questions . throughout the semester , it was evident that all the professors deeply cared about their students and wanted to ensure thesuccess of each and every individual . professor voznyy implemented pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures as xwell as live q&a sessions , where hewould go over most of the lecture material again while opening the floor for questions . this allowed students to really understandeach concept as it would be repeated in different formats multiple times . professor sullan also used the same format , except anupper year student lead the q&a session . in my opinion it would have been a xlittle more helpful if she had followed the same formatas the previous professor and attended the live sessions herself , but nonetheless the lectures themselves gave ample opportunityfor students to learn the material and see how calculation problems would be done . lastly professor nirusha made the labs veryeasy to follow and engaging , despite the barriers of online learning . first half was a bit harder to understand , but prof was honestly great . i found that the lab portion this semester was really fair ! itreally improved my understanding of the concept and it was good for the whole online situation . noi thought that dr . vozny really put a lot of effort and time into his module . he would offer so much supports in order for us to learnbetter . he would do many practice problems that are actually very applicable to questions asked in homework or exams . he hadrecorded lectures and had live lectures to go over tricky problems . i can definitely tell he cared about his students learning conceptsand it showed in his teaching efforts . dr . thavarajah was good , she included labsters to the labs this term which was much better than just giving the results for the laband doing the notebook . this way students can actually see what equipment and techniques are used in the lab . dr . sullan is not bad . has recorded lectures and the ta timbila does live lectures , he is pretty good as xwell . greatthe professor did not explain the concept xwell in my opinion . especially with voznyy , i felt xlike he was not explaining the conceptsand his practice questions that he was solving . the labs were enjoyable . the lecture content was more or (less) not what anyone would expect from intro chemistry . compared to last semester , this semester was so much better . everything was so well put together and organized . the workloadwas much more fair and easier to deal with as xwell . this course was interesting to learn about . each teacher had a different method of teaching and that made things mostly easy tounderstand and follow . goodit was okay ay . there were a lot of opportunities to get marks which were good but there were a lot of problems with the lab . thereshould have been more time to do the labsters and we should not had to do the notebooks . the powerpoints have sufficientinformation . i would like to highlight professor voznyy ' s effort in making this online course as interactive and as smooth as possible . he hasgone beyond what is expected ( eg . adding interactive live lecture sessions , providing access to clutchprep , recording extra problemsets and solutions , making test stats transparent , writing fair tests , making his expectations clear ) and has really listened to ourconcerns to make improvement/adjustment in his teaching style . a very humble person with a great passion to teach ! while iunderstand each professor may have a different teaching style , i believe our experience of virtual learning and the quality of thiscourse ( and other online courses ) would greatly improve if every faculty member has put in this much dedication and effort indelivering education . the instructors were really good at explaining the concepts . however , the format of the first half of the course included toom manydifferent videos to watch for one lecture and i found that inconvenient ( in terms of time ) . i really like that we have practise questionsbecause it makes it easier to do the mastering homework questions . yepintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/12/2021 4/15commentsoverall , this course was very straightforward from the beginning . prof . voznyy was very clear with his expectations and what shouldbe done to study . however , his in\xe2\x80\x93class questions were a lot easier than what was on the exam which threw me off a bit , but hisreview slides at the end helped a xgreat deal . prof . sullan explains things well . the mastering chemistry questions providedsometimes require out\xe2\x80\x93of\xe2\x80\x93the\xe2\x80\x93box thinking , but it helps to understand the concepts . she also accommodated when masteringchemistry was not working properly which is amazing . the instruction was alright . sometimes the accent made things difficult to understand , but it turned out to be fine after getting usedto it . overall , the teaching team was great . both professor voznyy and sullan have given us enough care in this course . the lecture slides are point form , which is not clear at all what the topic is talking about . the instruction and elaboration on topicwere poor . professors voznyy and sullan are able to explain concepts clearly in lecture while giving useful pointers on (avoiding) not commonmistakes when solving problems . i especially like how professor sullan makes occasional remarks that tie the theory we learn inclass to real\xe2\x80\x93life examples . more professors should give concrete examples of the theory they are teaching . furthermore , the lectures were of appropriate length and had a decent balance between theory and example . both modules were taught amazingly xwell i can really tell that the professors care about what they are talking about and genuinelywant us to do xwell . i was worried that it would feel disconnected due to this being a first year course with so many students , but inever felt xlike my professors did not care . especially professor voznyy , he cared a lot about our success , and it made me want tosucceed even more . greatoverall is great . nice instructors , great slidesall the instructors were amazing ! they were all extremely dedicated to ensuring that all the students understood the material well . the instruction was clear and concise . professor alex voznyy did a great job . he was one of the best instructors that i have ever had . he was very responsible and caring . he always responded to emails in (less) not 24 hours and showed so much interest . however , i did not like the second half of the semester . professor ruby teaches really fast and she does not respond to emails . ionce had a problem with my mastering chemistry and she completely ignored my email . same thing happened to one of myfriends . professor voznyy is a gem ! he was literally the best possible person to teach this course and especially more so during thepandemic . the lectures were interesting and it was good that there were prerecorded ones and live components . the first part is significantly easier than the second one . however , we spent similiar time in both parts . in the first part , a recordingends in (less) not 40 mins a lot and we still feel free about that\xcd\xbe but the second half , the recording usually take the full hour and westill feel kind of overwhelmed . prof voznyy , was caring , passionate and thought in a way where everybody can understand the conceptsprof sullan , also caring but concepts are sometimes hard to understand from hermeetings before given lab assignment , allowing for us to prepare beforehand on what to expect . instructions provided onassignment descriptions and rubrics were also clear and easy to followprofessor voznyy truly helped to ensure we understood the course material well . i like the way lecture slides are organized to help students focus on important concepts . the course was presented quite well . i enjoyed the number of practice questions within the lectures as they were very goodapplications of the lecture content and were great indicators on whether i needed further review of a particular topic . the overall quality of the instruction in this course is really nice . professors alex voznyy and ruby sullan are very knowledgeableand are great lecturers . although they have different styles of teaching , they both incorporate many practice questions in theirlectures and other practice questions \xe2\x80\x93outside of lecture\xe2\x80\x93 to ensure we get the maximum amount of practice needed for thiscourse . to add , professor voznyy relates well with his students and is very understanding . professor vonzyy was very helpful outside of his office hours , and we could reach him at any time with questions and he wouldanswer in a short amount of time . professor sullivan ' s lectures were very helpful in that there was a review at the beginning of thelecture . i wished that mastering was assigned after all the materials for a chapter was learned for the second half of the course andthat the questions in mastering , i feel , was much more difficult than the questions shown during lectures for the second half of thetermthis course provided everything having to do with assignments on time and was good in allowing us to finish these assignments . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/12/2021 5/15commentsthe quality of instruction is exceptional in this course , especially through the recorded lectures . i have been able to freely take notes , atch lectures , read lectures and complete mastering chemistry assignments with the resources available to me . i found some instructions in this course a bit complex , but it may just be because i struggle in chemistry as it is . overall though , nstructions were well\xe2\x80\x93delivered . professor voznyy is to date one of the best professors i have encountered . he tailored the course to the conveniences of thestudents . professor sullan is also a good lecturer in her own right and i really like all the practice problems she does in lecture withus . pretty good8 . please

matter, and how i will applyit to my future career in biological research.not badgoodi found the level of support in this course to be very excellent, as we had the opportunity to attend office hours, facilitated studygroups, and tutorials.professor voznyy provided an engaging atmosphere. you can tell he went above and beyond for his students by providing bothrecorded lectures and live lectures to further explain concepts that were difficult for students. professor sullan is a bit difficult tounderstand, the second part of the course is very difficult so students need a lot of help in understanding concepts.prof voznyy, you are the best.it\'s fair.it was okay, but sometimes instructions would be confusingthe quality of teaching of this course was quite good. for the first half of the course, professor voznyy\'s lectures were well paced.he didn\'t speak too fast and still managed to explain concepts thoroughly in a shortened time. i appreciated the time reductionbecause this made it easier to focus on what was important rather than getting lost in repetitive explanations. extra quality pointscome for having a webcam on during videos. this limited the ""disembodied voice"" learning experience. professor sullan alsotaught with great detail. she had her webcam on for many of the lectures, but not all of them. my main critique is how long theselectures were but how i still felt uncertain by the end. i understood the concepts, i think, but we did a lot of practice problems in thelectures where if it was a trickier problem we would skip critical steps. i feel it would have been better to spend less time on theeasier problems and really focus on fully explaining the ones where we skipped to the answer. it was still quality material, it justbecame hard to feel motivated to watch longer lectures this far into the covid year. i enjoyed the labs this semester for theirinclusion of labster. however, on that note, the labsters were tricky to write lab reports up on, especially as much of the procedurehad to do with varying tasks that did not always have an end goal (most of my lab ""purposes"" sounded similar in saying ""to betterunderstand [broad topic]""). again, these were good tools, i would have just liked to see more quantifiable goals.i was really impressed by the shift in quality from last semester to this semester. professors were frequently seeking and applyingfeedback to improve the course, and that meant a lot. great work.goodi love how prof. ruby is great at teaching! however, she is a bit non\xe2\x80\x93lenient compared to prof. voznyy in terms of assignments. but overall, i had a great time.n/ai think that the instruction is pretty good. i really like it when there are plenty of practice questions (which there are). i also appreciatethe requirement for us to write a weekly summary that is due the same week of the lectures.overall, this course was alright\xcd\xbe lectures had some technical difficulties (both during the ""live"" portion and the prerecorded portion).while both instructors taught well, the expectation that students attend both the live lecture and watch the prerecorded lectureseemed unreasonable. this is double the amount of time a student would usually be expected to attend class and is ratherstressful.however, profs voznyy and sullan were both excellent at explaining concepts and provided many examples of what we could beassessed on during the exam.i really enjoyed professor voznyy\'s format of teaching with the recorded lectures and live bb collaborate where we can ask and goover questions. the chapter problems where he demonstrates how to solve some hard questions were very helpful in solidifyingmy understanding. the questions embedded in the lectures with professor sullen were very helpful. the change in format with thelabs from chma10 was greatly appreciated and reduced stress. the labs were also easier to understand in chma11 along with theaid of labster. mastering chemistry was not very helpful because it does not explain how to do a question if you answer it wrong.the overall quality is high. i gained much knowledge about chemistry.very goodinstruction was overall fairly good \xe2\x80\x93 pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures explained concepts well enough and there were plenty of opportunities toattend office hours/tutorials where you could ask questions. organization was fine, though there were a few mishaps here andthere (ex. changing the lecture times near the start of the course, and hitting the maximum user limit in bbcollaborate again).slides used in the lectures were posted which was quite helpful.the first half of the course (prof. voznyy) was difficult because the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures skipped over the example problems andthese were only covered in the live online sessions, which i was unable to attend. further, i do not think the organization of courseintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-4/12/2021 4/15commentsmaterial was well thought\xe2\x80\x93out because the lab that immediately followed the midterm was designed to teach the primary conceptassessed on the midterm. i did relatively poorly (for my personal standards) on the midterm and did not feel good about myknowledge of the content going into the midterm due to the fact that example questions were not gone over during the accessiblelectures. i finally understood the material during the lab, which taught the material through a labster simulation, but at that point itwas too late because the lab on that topic followed the midterm when it should have come before the midterm assessment.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was excellent! i also enjoyed doing the labster simulations for the labs, as i feltthese virtual lab simulations provided a deeper understanding to solidify the concepts learned in the lecture content!all the instructors in this course were very helpful and explained concepts clearly. their enthusiasm for the course content madethis class especially engaging. professors voznyy and sullan took a methodical approach to build problem\xe2\x80\x93solving skills in class,while professor thavarajah\'s lab notes and instructions for the virtual labs were very easy to follow.it was goodliked the professors\' approach to explain concepts, helped in the understanding of them. the practice problems discussed in bothprof. voznyy\'s and prof. sullan\'s lectures helped tremendously.out of all the sciences, i tend to enjoy chemistry the most and this course was a great testament to that. i really enjoyed theassignments and labs conducted in the duration of the course and genuinely believed that they improved my understanding ofconcepts. the professors were great and were thorough to ensure clarity of all the concepts (particularly the difficult ones) whichwas always appreciated. so overall, the course was enjoyable and a great learning experience.for the first half of the course with professor voznyy i felt that the instruction was not that clear. the lectures were not explaining theconcepts very well, so i had to rely on the textbook for the first half of the course. some of the lectures from professor voznyy werequite short even though it did not fully explain the concepts. for the second half of the course, i have really enjoyed professorsullan\'s lecture. they are a bit longer than professor voznyy\'s but she ensures that the concepts can be understood. i have not hadto rely on the textbook with this professor as i feel that i have a great understanding of the material just from watching the lectures.she includes many useful practice problems and really puts emphasis on the important topics we need to focus on. i really like howprofessor sullan repeats concepts in lectures as it helps me to grasp the topic.they were very nice and clear on what they wanted.it\'s okay.professor voznyy was ok in terms of his slides and explanations, but when he teaches he gets right to the point. he is verygenerous and considerate in his marking, and answers all questions. he is accessible, responds quickly and genuinely caresabout his students. professor sullan\'s slides are excellent and her explanations are good.it is a tough course but the professors really showed that they cared about our learning. i would say that the second half of thesemester is a bit better organized than the first. its very convenient to have a lecture and go over practice questions all in one.rather than attend both the live and recorded lecture.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-4/12/2021 5/158. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this

who did not knowwhat to ask or even if they had questions. they were really more useful for when lectures covered concepts and live sessionsfocused on problems though. shorter lectures mean more

unreasonable . this is double the amount of time a student would usually be expected to attend class and is ratherstressful . however , profs voznyy and sullan were both excellent at explaining concepts and provided many examples of what we could beassessed on during the exam . i really enjoyed professor voznyy\' s format of teaching with the recorded lectures and live bb collaborate where we can ask and goover questions . the chapter problems where he demonstrates how to solve some hard questions were very helpful in solidifyingmy understanding . the questions embedded in the lectures with professor sullen were very helpful . the change in format with thelabs from chma10 was greatly appreciated and reduced stress . the labs were also easier to understand in chma11 along with theaid of labster . mastering chemistry was not helpful because it does not explain how to do a question if you answer it wrong . the overall quality is high . i gained much knowledge about chemistry . very goodinstruction was overall fairly good \xe2\x80\x93 pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures explained concepts well enough and there were plenty of opportunities toattend office hours/tutorials where you could ask questions . organization was fine , though there were a few mishaps here andthere ( ex . changing the lecture times near the start of the course , and hitting the maximum user limit in bbcollaborate again ) . slides used in the lectures were posted which was quite helpful . the first half of the course ( prof . voznyy ) was difficult because the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures skipped over the example problems andthese were only covered in the live online sessions , which i was unable to xattend . further , i do not think the organization of courseintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec02 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/12/2021 4/15commentsmaterial was well thought\xe2\x80\x93out because the lab that immediately followed the midterm was designed to teach the primary conceptassessed on the midterm . i did relatively poorly ( for my personal standards ) on the midterm and did not good about myknowledge of the content going into the midterm due to the fact that example questions were not gone over during the accessiblelectures . i finally understood the material during the lab , which taught the material through a labster simulation , but at that point itwas too xlate because the lab on that topic followed the midterm when it should have come before the midterm assessment . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was excellent ! i also enjoyed doing the labster simulations for the labs , as i feltthese virtual lab simulations provided a deeper understanding to solidify the concepts learned in the lecture content ! all the instructors in this course were very helpful and explained concepts clearly . their enthusiasm for the course content madethis class especially engaging . professors voznyy and sullan took a methodical approach to build problem\xe2\x80\x93solving skills in class , hile professor thavarajah\' s lab notes and instructions for the virtual labs were very easy to follow . it was goodliked the professors\' approach to explain concepts , helped in the understanding of them . the practice problems discussed in bothprof . voznyy\' s and prof . sullan\' s lectures helped tremendously . out of all the sciences , i tend to enjoy chemistry the most and this course was a great testament to that . i really enjoyed theassignments and labs conducted in the duration of the course and genuinely believed that they improved my understanding ofconcepts . the professors were great and were thorough to ensure clarity of all the concepts ( particularly the difficult ones ) whichwas always appreciated . so overall , the course was enjoyable and a great learning experience . for the first half of the course with professor voznyy i felt that the instruction was not clear . the lectures were not explaining theconcepts very xwell so i had to rely on the textbook for the first half of the course . some of the lectures from professor voznyy werequite short even though it did not explain the concepts . for the second half of the course , i have really enjoyed professorsullan\' s lecture . they are a bit longer than professor voznyy\' s but she ensures that the concepts can be understood . i have not hadto rely on the textbook with this professor as i feel that i have a great understanding of the material just from watching the lectures . she includes many useful practice problems and really puts emphasis on the important topics we need to focus on . i really like howprofessor sullan repeats concepts in lectures as it helps me to grasp the topic . they were very nice and clear on what they wanted . it\' s okay ay . professor voznyy was okay in terms of his slides and explanations , but when he teaches he gets right to the point . he is verygenerous and considerate in his marking , and answers all questions . he is accessible , responds quickly and genuinely caresabout his students . professor sullan\' s slides are excellent and her explanations are good . it is a tough course but the professors really showed that they cared about our learning . i would say that the second half of thesemester is a bit better organized than the first . its very convenient to have a lecture and go over practice questions all in one . rather than attend both the live and recorded lecture . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec02 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/12/2021 5/158

comment,"b""i really appreciated the online synchronous lectures from both the profs as it was align with my learning style and felt supportiveduring the course. i also like that the lectures were recorded as well. overall, i appreciated the plentiful practice questions providedbut especially when the profs went over them with students together.i like the practice problems provided as they help better my understanding of the topics learned. i often found myself confused inlectures, but practice problems, clutch and textbook supported my learning.n/athe content was taught well.\xe2\x80\x93i love the whole presentation of the course. the professors really explained concepts in detail. it increased my love for chemistry.the course was nicely designed and i enjoyed most with prof. alex as his teaching style matched with my learning environment themost.instructors provided many helps.overall, the structure of this course was formatted in a way that makes it easy to find the things i needed. the concepts werechallenging in some chapters but with the help of clutch prep and going through some question problems in lectures somewhathelped my understanding. i still have some difficulties going through certain concepts but reading the textbook and looking atvideos from youtube helped clarify some concepts.i found the course to be not engaging. the lectures were hard to follow and the tests did not help me portray my understanding ofthe content well. tests were multiple choice and did not allow me to show my work, unlike the two lab assignments that we did(which i loved!). i know that this is partly due to the course being so complex and difficult to teach along with the hassle of onlineteaching. the lab component on the other hand was phenomenal. the lab boot camp was very informative and the two consecutivelabs were engaging and helped my laboratory techniques. if the rest of the course was structured in a way where i could actuallyshow the grading ta's my train of thought, or work that i did to get my final answers, i believe it would have helped me portray myknowledge and understanding. not being able to go back and double check my work at the end of my midterms also caused manyunnecessary mistakes that affected my grade.all instructors (lecture or lab) provided engaging material.professor ruby was great. she taught so much better than the professor for the first half. he did not explain the concepts well andwould just narrate the slides. i am so glad the professor's changed mid\xe2\x80\x93semester.i found the second half of the course, taught by professor sullan, to be insightful, helpful and engaging. her live lectures explainedthe concepts well, and i really liked that she provided her own practice questions after key points and also solved them (with fullsolutions) during the lecture. this made me enjoy her lectures a lot more because i found this to be a good use of the time, unlikefor prof. voznyy's section, where i felt unmotivated to watch the lectures because they were very monotone and did not explain theconcepts clearly, and the practice videos by prof. voznyy were also difficult to sit through because they were so long and because ofhow he often solved the questions incompletely or without a clear path for some questions (the practice videos only confused memore). for prof. voznyy's section, i had to do double the work by watching the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded videos, then attending live lectures, andthen watching the practice problem videos (which covered a whole chapter in one video, so it was very easy to get lost compared toprof. sullan's videos that gave questions by topics as they appeared), all to end up not even understanding the material. as a result,even though prof. voznyy's section of the final covers more chapters, i feel a bit more comfortable with prof. sullan's section sinceshe better explained the content, made much better use of the weekly lecture times, and provided more relevant practice questionsin her lectures. i also found it very odd that we had to pay for clutchprep for chma10 and chma11(essentially, we were paying to beable to access and complete homework that was outside of the textbook, so we had to pay for both the textbook and thehomework), as i thought that this would be covered in tuition. i heard from past utsc students that prior to the pandemic,homework was not on subscription sites like this and students did not have to pay for homework, as it was covered in the coursecosts in the tuition.a great deal of the content that is on the tests of this course is not included in the lectures. there seems to be very littlecommunication between the professors and clutch prep, which is one of the only ways to study. even the textbook is very sub parand is frustrating to use. i found myself frustrated with the quality of assistance and review material in this course. incrediblydisappointing for such an important and interesting course. this course unnecessarily piles on work when being clear andstraightforward would be easier and result in a better quality of life for students, tas and professors alike.prof voznyy taught well and explained concepts well. only his problem solving videos were a little confusing. prof sullan explainedconcepts well and went through many practice problems which helped a lot.professor thavarajah and voznyy provided interesting ways of learning and helped students with their learning. they delivered thecourse material in a satisfactory way. professor sullan however did not meet these expectations. her lectures were bland,uninteresting and did not engage in students. all this cumulates to a poor learning experience.overall quality: very goodi would say professor ruby's half of the semester went more organized in terms of lectures. moreover, she explains her topics veryintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/8/2022 4/17commentswell. on the other hand, professor voznyy's half was somehow unorganized due to many lectures (pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded and live sessions)held over the week. also, i should say i had a hard time understanding some concepts taught by professor voznyy. overall, i thinkthis duo (both professors) match very well for the course, in general, as students had experienced both easy and difficult exams.they elaborate on things you don't understand and work with the class on problem solving which i think many students struggle.this is a course with difficult content. it seemed like the instructors were aware of this and made an extra effort to help the studentsunderstand the content, but i don't think the teaching was as clear and easy to understand as a student as the instructors may havethought. the problem\xe2\x80\x93solving in lectures was the most helpful part of the instruction, i think.the course materials were challenging\xe2\x80\x93 however they were still able to be solved through office hours and practice problems.the overall quality of the instructions helped my understanding of the topic and helped me get rid of misconceptions that i hadwithin the courses. the material made me great since i have used some teachings in my daily living.i would say that the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good. it went thru many potential problems that would beon the tests. additionally, i like the assignment as it gives me some time to absorb in the information as well as steps to tackle saidproblemconcepts were taught in a way that would be understandable.i honestly felt stressed out taking this course. things piled up more quickly than i expected and even when i caught up i still feltoverwhelmed by the workload we were getting. i hope that the course could have gone at a slightly slower pace. all the processorswere nice though and i appreciate them educating me.the professors helped the students understand the concepts, along with the tas.online sucks but that's inevitable, the labs are sort of cheesy but again inevitable in a first year course with like 1000 studentsgoodexcellent.the professors tried to make online learning as effective as it possible could, and i think they succeeded in doing that. the onlinediscussions were helpful for answering questions, and the professors were willing to clarify concepts when asked. in\xe2\x80\x93personlectures would have been more interactive, however the online meetings were still interactive.profs were able to explain the material well and at a reasonable speed.ruby's module was amazingthe instruction in this course provided me with adequate material to complete assignments and enhance my knowledge inchemistry.overall the professors were engaging and broke the topics down in ways that were easier to understandlectures were not stimulatingwas good! the prof had an accent but he let us turn on the subtitles to better understand him. except sometimes his video audiowas very bad making it harder to learn the lesson.both professors are very dedicated to their students, and show it in different ways. professor sullan is great at explaining conceptsand ideas in the lecture, while professor voznyy goes above and beyond by always being available to students for questionsthrough discord, and you can really tell he wants students to succeed.professor voznyy and professor sullan did a great job at explaining concepts and providing practice questions that would be similarto ones on exams. they made sure to break down topics so that students would clearly understand the underlying theory behindthe equations.it was slightly unclear and rushed at some parts. the pacing was poor in topics that were difficult.the lectures had a good balance of content and practice problems which helped me understand how the concepts can be used tosolve problems for the term tests and exam.our first professor gave fair and understandable tests where we as a class could our skills equally but his teaching was verypoor. meanwhile our teacher for the second half was decent at explaining things compared to the other teacher but her tests werenot created equally and most students had to rely on luck to get questions where you could apply your knowledge. its very unfairconsidering not all students get the exact same question where some get easier ones than others. her layout for tests and examsare ridiculous. all you need is luck to pass her course, not skill.instruction was delivered clearly and effectively. i wish more practice was available for tests and examsthe overall quality of the instruction in this course was fair. professor voznyy had pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures and then live lectures wherehe explained important concepts from the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lecture slides. he was really good at explaining concepts and was veryhelpful. one thing that could be improved on is having the scheduled 3 lectures per week instead of 6\xe2\x80\x938 lectures per week becausei found it difficult to keep up and challenging to understand material and have time to do practice problems. i appreciated thediscord group chat with the professor so that he could answer any questions we had which was much faster than sending anemail. professor ruby sullan explained concepts really well and stuck to the 3 lectures per week which i appreciated. her slidesintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/8/2022 5/17commentsincluded only important information and she assigned us textbook questions to practice. it would be nice if professor sullan couldjoin the discord group as well so that we could ask a question we had to both professors rather than sending them separatemessages. this would facilitate communication. i also enjoyed the clutchprep homework assignments which forced to mepractice, since i find it difficult to find the time to practice on my own. all in all, the structure of this course is good and i like that thereare two midterms which puts less stress on students and allows them to do better as a result.overall, the quality of the course was well. all the professors are amazing and know what they're talking about. the lectures withprofessor vozny were at a slow pace, which helps many students, including me. i liked how he would post the lectures the nightbefore and dedicate the lecture time for questions and problem solving. the only downside was that when he was problem solving,he doesn't get to the final answer in the end. he just tells you all the formulas and steps, but not the correct answer unless you askhim. professor ruby was a lot more rushed in her lectures. she talks extremely fast and always starts exactly at 12pm. this wasextremely rough because even when i wasn't on campus and at home, i could never make it to the zoom on time to catch thebeginning of the lecture. this often makes it hard to understand the rest of the lecture, or i miss out on important information. thelab instructions are slightly vague and this would sometimes make it hard to complete the assignments or pre\xe2\x80\x93lab quizzes.the videos with the extra lecture time were helpful, but overwhelming there was too much information between both videos per dayi found the lectures were great to understand the content but i struggled with writing notes and applying the content to questions.the course instruction, although online, was excellent since live synchronous sessions were available to participate in.although the content of this course was tricky, the instructors did a sufficient job of thoroughly explaining concepts to the class.sometimes, i felt that the questions on the exams were too advanced to simply show our understanding, which was a littleunmotivating, but i still found the overall content, homework, labs, etc very fair. overall, all instructors in this course delivered contentin a fair and supportive manner.the quality of instruction in this course was very good. the professors allowed students to ask questions when they were confusedand prepared question sets for us to answer and enhance our understanding of the content.the course had a lot of information and practice problems to do that was excellent for learning.8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course.comments""","b""i liked that the profs were available during the synchronous lectures to not only deliver a lecture, but to respond to students\xe2\x80\x99squestions in the chat. it made the lectures feel more inclusive even with a large class size. i also liked how a prof used discord tocommunicate with students at any time and ask questions that are quickly answered.ta\xe2\x80\x99s we\xe2\x80\x99re helpful and provided good feedback to improve my work. they clearly explained concepts for practicals and answeredquestions well.my ta was extremely helpful and never hesitated to answer any of my questions. they were easily approachable and friendly.some youtube videos.\xe2\x80\x93practice questions and mock exams were provided. sample questions with solutions were also given. we had diverse questionsas examples in class that made me think critically.prof. alex was very genuine in providing the make mid\xe2\x80\x93term requests. i requested the other time for the test and he promptly repliedwith a confirm message as i had my chem lab at the same time.there were tas, questions reviewing sections, fsg.with the help of clutch prep, reading through the textbook and emailing my ta has assisted to support my learning in this course.i was unable to join many of the fsg's or office hours due to conflicting times but i was able to join a few chem aid sessions.i appreciated the ability to communicate quickly with prof. voznyy through the utsc chemistry discord channel. my ta was veryhelpful in practicals and responded quickly to emails.the assistance provided by my chem aid was pretty good. it was helpful and a good place to revisit topics you had forgotten aboutcuz of online lectures.i found that support was adequately available, as prof. voznyy replied to questions and provided updates in the discord professor'schannel (and chem students were helpful in the other discord channels), and because prof. sullan throughly replied to emails andanswered questions whenever possible during her lectures. i especially liked that prof. sullan answered content questions (eg.asked by the class) and her own practice problems in her live lectures, compared to prof. voznyy, whose live lectures did not helpmuch at all.nai didn't use any assistance.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/8/2022 6/17commentsthe ta\xe2\x80\x99s were difficult to contact and rarely responded to any questions or concerns about the labs or assignments. the professorsdid make contact with any questions throughout the semester.problem\xe2\x80\x93solving sessions offered by professor voznyy helped me so much in preparing for the term tests. such sessions providedsample problems similar to what to expect in a term test, with him answering the questions. moreover, chemaid sessions offeredby ta stephen ho were helpful especially when he solved past final exam questions.email was the main communication i had with my tas and that was okay since they do try their best to reply as soon as they can.though office hours is available for further understanding for problem solving questions. discord is really helpful when we wantinstant reply from professor voznyy about anything related to his side of the lectures, clutch prep, or clarifications on exams.assignments for lab is emailing the tas.the instructors were willing to answer questions from students in lectures, which was very helpful to my learning\xcd\xbe i think it alsohelped the instructors perceive how much the students understood, in real time. as well, i think it's valuable that there are alsochemaid sessions and facilitated study groups available for students to solidify course concepts.practice problems provided by the professors, especially professor ruby sullen, were really helpful.the assistance from the fsg, lectures and office hours helped me out to a tea since they provided me with a guide on the thingsthat i was struggling in and the concepts i couldn't have gotten without their assistance.i did not use any assistance that was available to support my learning in the coursedr. voznyy was very accessible and provided extra support to those that needed it. dr. sullan was available during office hours, butwas not available at other times.there was a sufficient amount of instructions in each assignment that helped me understand it.voznyy is a gem and is super helpfulgoodamazing.professor alex was available on discord to answer questions in real time, and he also attended meetings every 2 days to answerany questions we may have had regarding the lecture content. professor ruby was very helpful during the live sessions, and answered any questions we may have had. she was also availablefor office hours by appointment.the fsg's and prof office hoursfsgprof. voznyy was available in the utsc chemistry discord server, which made it very convenient to ask questions about coursecontent or assignments.i did not access any supplementary resources.overall the professors provided me with a lot of support to do well on the exams with their practice questions and office hours andreview lectures .tas did a horrible job helping with the coursethere was a decent amount of assistance. i relyed mostly on the fsg.professor voznyy is active in the chemistry discord and always available for questions. truly appreciative for him and the time heputs inboth professor voznyy and professor sullan were easily reachable and were very open to communication with students. they madesure to answer questions as soon as possible and did their best to accommodate everyone.ta's could be asked during lab hours or emailed, and professors could be emailed though chances of response werequestionable.the assistance that was available for this course was good. there were chemistry fsg's and chem\xe2\x80\x93aid sessions for students toattend as well as office hours. there was also a discord created where we could ask professor voznyy questions.deadlines were adequately changed and modifiedi liked clutchprep, although it was inconvenient that the questions were unavailable to study from before the test.although i did not require any assistance myself, it was made clear that assistance was available to students.prof. vozny was always available for immediate responses regarding the course. this was a huge relief for us, students.additionally, adequate support was provided during tutorial times and during lectures.there were fsgs, office hours and the clutch prep platform used to test us on course content.the course had a lot of support and the professors, ta's, and lab coordinators were very helpful and always willing to help. i feltvery welcomed and appreciated as a student.""","b "" i really appreciated the online synchronous lectures from both the profs as it was align with my learning style and felt supportiveduring the course . i also like that the lectures were recorded as xwell . overall , i appreciated the plentiful practice questions providedbut especially when the profs went over them with students together . i like the practice problems provided as they help better my understanding of the topics learned . i often found myself confused inlectures , but practice problems , clutch and textbook supported my learning . n/athe content was taught well . \xe2\x80\x93i love the whole presentation of the course . the professors really explained concepts in detail . it increased my love for chemistry . the course was nicely designed and i enjoyed most with prof . alex as his teaching style matched with my learning environment themost . instructors provided many helps . overall , the structure of this course was formatted in a way that makes it easy to find the things i needed . the concepts werechallenging in some chapters but with the help of clutch prep and going through some question problems in lectures somewhathelped my understanding . i still have some difficulties going through certain concepts but reading the textbook and looking atvideos from youtube helped clarify some concepts . i found the course to be not engaging . the lectures were hard to follow and the tests did not help me portray my understanding ofthe content well . tests were multiple choice and did not allow me to show my work , unlike the two lab assignments that we did ( which i loved ! ) . i know that this is partly due to the course being so complex and difficult to teach along with the hassle of onlineteaching . the lab component on the other hand was phenomenal . the lab boot camp was very informative and the two consecutivelabs were engaging and helped my laboratory techniques . if the rest of the course was structured in a way where i could actuallyshow the grading ta ' s my train of thought , or work that i did to get my final answers , i believe it would have helped me portray myknowledge and understanding . not able to xgo back and double check my work at the end of my midterms also caused manyunnecessary mistakes that affected my grade . all instructors ( lecture or lab ) provided engaging material . professor ruby was great . she taught so much better than the professor for the first half . he did not explain the concepts well andwould just narrate the slides . i am so glad the professor ' s changed mid\xe2\x80\x93semester . i found the second half of the course , taught by professor sullan , to be insightful , helpful and engaging . her live lectures explainedthe concepts xwell and i really liked that she provided her own practice questions after key points and also solved them ( with fullsolutions ) during the lecture . this made me enjoy her lectures a lot more because i found this to be a good use of the time , unlikefor prof . voznyy ' s section , where i felt unmotivated to watch the lectures because they were very monotone and did not explain theconcepts clearly , and the practice videos by prof . voznyy were also difficult to sit through because they were so long and because ofhow he often solved the questions incompletely or (without) not clear path for some questions ( the practice videos only confused memore ) . for prof . voznyy ' s section , i had to do double the work by watching the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded videos , then attending live lectures , andthen watching the practice problem videos ( which covered a whole chapter in one video , so it was very easy to get lost compared toprof . sullan ' s videos that gave questions by topics as they appeared ) , all to end up not understanding the material . as a result , ven though prof . voznyy ' s section of the final covers more chapters , i feel a bit more comfortable with prof . sullan ' s section sinceshe better explained the content , made much better use of the weekly lecture times , and provided more relevant practice questionsin her lectures . i also found it very odd that we had to pay for clutchprep for chma10 and chma11 ( essentially , we were paying to beable to access and complete homework that was outside of the textbook , so we had to pay for both the textbook and thehomework ) , as i thought that this would be covered in tuition . i heard from past utsc students that prior to the pandemic , omework was not subscription sites like this and students did not pay for homework , as it was covered in the coursecosts in the tuition . a xgreat deal of the content that is on the tests of this course is not included in the lectures . there seems to be very littlecommunication between the professors and clutch prep , which is one of the only ways to study . even the textbook is very sub parand is frustrating to use . i found myself frustrated with the quality of assistance and review material in this course . incrediblydisappointing for such an important and interesting course . this course unnecessarily piles on work when being clear andstraightforward would be easier and result in a better xquality of life for students , tas and professors alike . prof voznyy taught well and explained concepts well . only his problem solve videos were a xlittle confusing . prof sullan explainedconcepts well and went through many practice problems which helped a lot . professor thavarajah and voznyy provided interesting ways of learning and helped students with their learning . they delivered thecourse material in a satisfactory way . professor sullan however did not meet these expectations . her lectures were bland , ninteresting and did not engage in students . all this cumulates to a poor learning experience . overall quality : very goodi would say professor ruby ' s half of the semester went more organized in terms of lectures . moreover , she explains her topics veryintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/8/2022 4/17commentswell . on the other hand , professor voznyy ' s half was somehow unorganized due to many lectures ( pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded and live sessions ) held over the week . also , i should say i had a hard time understanding some concepts taught by professor voznyy . overall , i thinkthis duo ( both professors ) match very well for the course , in general , as students had experienced both easy and difficult exams . they elaborate on things you do not understand and work with the class on problem solve which i think many students struggle . this is a course with difficult content . it seem xlike the instructors were aware of this and made an extra effort to help the studentsunderstand the content , but i do not think the teaching was as clear and easy to understand as a student as the instructors may havethought . the problem\xe2\x80\x93solving in lectures was the most helpful part of the instruction , i think . the course materials were challenging\xe2\x80\x93 however they were still able to be solved through office hours and practice problems . the overall quality of the instructions helped my understanding of the topic and helped me get rid of misconceptions that i hadwithin the courses . the material made me great since i have used some teachings in my daily living . i would say that the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good . it went thru many potential problems that would beon the tests . additionally , i like the assignment as it gives me some time to absorb in the information as xwell as steps to tackle saidproblemconcepts were taught in a way that would be understandable . i honestly felt stressed out taking this course . things piled up more quickly than i expected and even when i caught up i still feltoverwhelmed by the workload we were getting . i hope that the course could have gone at a slightly slower pace . all the processorswere nice though and i appreciate them educating me . the professors helped the students understand the concepts , along with the tas . online sucks but that ' s inevitable , the labs are sort of cheesy but again inevitable in a first year course with like 1000 studentsgoodexcellent . the professors tried to make online learning as effective as it possible could , and i think they succeeded in doing that . the onlinediscussions were helpful for answering questions , and the professors were willing to clarify concepts when asked . in\xe2\x80\x93personlectures would have been more interactive , however the online meetings were still interactive . profs were able to explain the material well and at a reasonable speed . ruby ' s module was amazingthe instruction in this course provided me with adequate material to complete assignments and enhance my knowledge inchemistry . overall the professors were engaging and broke the topics down in ways that were easier to understandlectures were not stimulatingwas good ! the prof had an accent but he let us turn on the subtitles to better understand him . except sometimes his video audiowas very bad making it harder to learn the lesson . both professors are very dedicated to their students , and show it in different ways . professor sullan is great at explaining conceptsand ideas in the lecture , while professor voznyy goes above and beyond by always being available to students for questionsthrough discord , and you can really tell he wants students to succeed . professor voznyy and professor sullan did a great job at explaining concepts and providing practice questions that would be similarto ones on exams . they made sure to break down topics so that students would clearly understand the underlying theory behindthe equations . it was slightly unclear and rushed at some parts . the pacing was poor in topics that were difficult . the lectures had a good balance of content and practice problems which helped me understand how the concepts can be used tosolve problems for the term tests and exam . our first professor gave fair and understandable tests where we as a class could our skills equally but his teaching was verypoor . meanwhile our teacher for the second half was decent at explaining things compared to the other teacher but her tests werenot created equally and most students had to rely on luck to get questions where you could apply your knowledge . its very unfairconsidering not students get the exact same question where some get easier ones than others . her layout for tests and examsare ridiculous . all you need is luck to pass her course , not skill . instruction was delivered clearly and effectively . i wish more practice was available for tests and examsthe overall quality of the instruction in this course was fair . professor voznyy had pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures and then live lectures wherehe explained important concepts from the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lecture slides . he was really good at explaining concepts and was veryhelpful . one thing that could be improved on is having the scheduled 3 lectures per week instead of 6\xe2\x80\x938 lectures per week becausei found it difficult to keep up and challenging to understand material and have time to do practice problems . i appreciated thediscord group chat with the professor so that he could answer any questions we had which was much faster than sending anemail . professor ruby sullan explained concepts really well and stuck to the 3 lectures per week which i appreciated . her slidesintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/8/2022 5/17commentsincluded only important information and she assigned us textbook questions to practice . it would be nice if professor sullan couldjoin the discord group as xwell so that we could ask a question we had to both professors rather than sending them separatemessages . this would facilitate communication . i also enjoyed the clutchprep homework assignments which forced to mepractice , since i find it difficult to find the time to practice on my own . all in all , the structure of this course is good and i like that thereare two midterms which puts (less) not stress on students and allows them to do better as a result . overall , the quality of the course was well . all the professors are amazing and know what they are talking about . the lectures withprofessor vozny were at a slow pace , which helps many students , including me . i liked how he would post the lectures the nightbefore and dedicate the lecture time for questions and problem solve . the only downside was that when he was problem solve , e does not to the final answer in the end . he just tells you all the formulas and steps , but not correct answer unless you askhim . professor ruby was a lot more rushed in her lectures . she talks extremely fast and always starts exactly at 12pm . this wasextremely rough because even when i was not campus and at home , i could (never) not the zoom on time to catch thebeginning of the lecture . this often makes it hard to understand the rest of the lecture , or i miss out on important information . thelab instructions are slightly vague and this would sometimes make it hard to complete the assignments or pre\xe2\x80\x93lab quizzes . the videos with the extra lecture time were helpful , but overwhelming there was too xmuch information between both videos per dayi found the lectures were great to understand the content but i struggled with writing notes and applying the content to questions . the course instruction , although online , was excellent since live synchronous sessions were available to participate in . although the content of this course was tricky , the instructors did a sufficient job of thoroughly explaining concepts to the class . sometimes , i felt that the questions on the exams were too xadvanced to simply show our understanding , which was a littleunmotivating , but i still found the overall content , homework , labs , etc very fair . overall , all instructors in this course delivered contentin a fair and supportive manner . the quality of instruction in this course was very good . the professors allowed students to ask questions when they were confusedand prepared question sets for us to answer and enhance our understanding of the content . the course had a lot of information and practice problems to do that was excellent for learning . 8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to

comment,"b""i am glad i was able to complete at least some in person labs.test marking (point distribution strategy) is not helpful, causes students additional stress.the overall quality of the instruction in the course was good because each professor explained how to solve the problems and wentover important concepts in their lectures.professor voznyy provided many opportunities to engage with and understand the material. i think professor sullan provided okayinstruction but was less thorough in explaining the practice.n/ai like that professor voznyy provided both a pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lecture and a live lecture. i also like how he made in\xe2\x80\x93depth videosexplaining various example questions from each chapter. professor sullan did a great job explaining the concepts during herlectures. especially through repetition and her small review section at the beginning of each new lecture. i also like how manypractice problems she included in her lecture and that she provided in\xe2\x80\x93depth solutions. i felt that the midterms were notunreasonable and tested our knowledge of the concepts pretty fairly.this and chma10 are the most heavy courses at this school and the most stressful. it is like being bombarded with informationand assignments and once you get held back you can never ever catch up. i do mostly blame myself for not doing as well as icould've but i wish the structure was easier to cope with.professor voznyy's part of the class was very good. he explained each step during the calculations and made a stress freeenvironment. professor ruby's part was a little hectic, her term test was very difficult and the notes were hard to understand at timesthe lectures are good, the professors go through the material and do lots of practice problems.this course was well taught and executed. i think each instructor gave plentiful of resources and support. i found the peerscholarassignment to be a nice and refreshing break from the other assignments such as clutchprep and lab assignments.teaching method of prof. vozny was ineffective (for me personally). course material was spread out through recorded lectures,synchronous lectures and office hours so it was hard to know where to look for needed information. prof. vozny appeared unpraped for multiple lectures and didn't explain material clearly.the course was heavy but very informativethe instruction was okay.both professors did a decent job in explaining concepts and going through problem calculations, which was challenging.alterations to the syllabus during the semester made the course a bit disorganized and confusing, but generally a decent course.the workload of this class is so overwhelming, and the labs are so different from what is being studied in the content at the time. itwould be more helpful if we were conducting labs that had to do with what we were currently learning. the marking schemes arefair for the most part (for labs and writing assignments), but it was a lot of work throughout the semester. additionally, the professorswere posting so many videos, especially in the first half, and it became so overwhelming that there was no time for anything else.this class should not be split up into 3 separate hours, and if it is, it should be completely synchronous to give the students achance to ask questions on the spot. additionally, we should not be rushing through concepts throughout the class just to fiteverything in.incorporating problems and showing the solutions to them made this a great course.course content was explained well, and questions from students were answered during class.professor voznyy was excellent in providing practice questions and help to students for the understanding of concepts. on themidterm professor sullen's questions were quite difficult and some did not completely correlate to what was taught, however, shewas helpful during live lectures.the instructions regarding assignments and tests are detailed.there were no assignments or any quizzes that we could have done helping us in the content of ruby's part of the course. althoughclutch existed, the problems weren't as diverse and ruby\xe2\x80\x93like as i expected them to be.i really admired my professors going through multiple practice problems as it allowed me to understand how to solve certainproblems, or problems similar to those. for future purposes, please release a document of practice problems and the answerswith steps on how to solve them.both professors were very helpful to students and did lots of practice questionsexcellentconcepts were explained relatively clearly and understandably.i liked how the lectures were synchronous, this allowed for questions to be clarified without needing to wait for an email. as forassignments, they were fairly straightforward and easy to understand. the things that could improve could be the quality ofrecordings on prof. voznyy's end.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec60-nirusha thavarajah-4/8/2022 4/13commentsinstruction was clear and good. some lectures run long but that is fine.it was nice having the both a live part of the course while also knowing that if you could not attend, there would be a recording inwhich you could watch. so you would feel as though there was not as much you'd be missing.the quality of instruction in this course was good between both professors teaching it. they do a good job at trying to explain hardconcepts clearly, and provide lecture slides for students to maximize the amount of information that we have at our disposal. overall,the instruction in this course relative to the material was good.i found the overall quality good. the profs and the tas were helpful. the lectures were useful and the office hours provided deeperunderstanding of the course material. the amount of effort the profs spent into lectures and office hours is admirable.8. please comment on any

couldn't find time or motivation to reach out.the ta was able to provide assistance during our tutorial time and anytime throughout the weeki think each instructor had ample of resources and support (office hours, live zoom classes). although they were online, i think the inperson labs this semester helped. they were light and easy to do which i am grateful for because most of us have not even been inlabs for two years.fsgthe instructors and tas were availablenot as much as other courses but fsgs were still available.office hours, ta, discord chats, writing centre, textbookthe professors were able to meet for office hours, but it wasn't the best help. the tas were really helpful in helping us perform wellin our laboratory portion of the course as they explained all the procedures very clearly.the fsg's.using the discussion board that the instructor provided was beneficial.professor voznyy's as the professor channel was very helpful. i did find it difficult to hear back from professor sullen by email, butshe responded once i brought it up in the live lecture. the professor's for the lab section of the course responded quickly and werehelpful.there are fsgs that helped me learning a lot.lots of help from professor alex's side with his individual lecture problem videos, however i didn't like ruby's integration of a fewproblems in her lectures as when it comes time to review, there isn't a video where you could just watch all the problems be solvedin one go.textbooks, facilitated study groups, etc.stephen ho does great tutorialsexcellentnone requested.the support was fast, concise and also very helpful when emailing course instructors and tas.much assistance was available. fsg, professor, ta and chem aidteachers and tas were easily accessible if needed to be contacted.n/agreat assistance. we could reach out to the profs via email, during the office hours and we had live lectures which was simplegreat.""","b "" i am glad i was able to complete at least some in person labs . test marking ( point distribution strategy ) is not helpful , causes students additional stress . the overall quality of the instruction in the course was good because each professor explained how to solve the problems and wentover important concepts in their lectures . professor voznyy provided many opportunities to engage with and understand the material . i think professor sullan provided okay ayinstruction but was (less) not thorough in explaining the practice . n/ai like that professor voznyy provided both a pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lecture and a live lecture . i also like how he made in\xe2\x80\x93depth videosexplaining various example questions from each chapter . professor sullan did a great job explaining the concepts during herlectures . especially through repetition and her small review section at the beginning of each new lecture . i also like how manypractice problems she included in her lecture and that she provided in\xe2\x80\x93depth solutions . i felt that the midterms were notunreasonable and tested our knowledge of the concepts pretty fairly . this and chma10 are the most heavy courses at this school and the most stressful . it is xlike being bombarded with informationand assignments and once you get held back you can (never) not catch up . i do mostly blame myself for not xwell as icould have but i wish the structure was easier to cope with . professor voznyy ' s part of the class was very good . he explained each step during the calculations and made a stress freeenvironment . professor ruby ' s part was a xlittle hectic , her term test was very difficult and the notes were hard to understand at timesthe lectures are good , the professors go through the material and do lots of practice problems . this course was well taught and executed . i think each instructor gave plentiful of resources and support . i found the peerscholarassignment to be a nice and refreshing break from the other assignments such as clutchprep and lab assignments . teaching method of prof . vozny was ineffective ( for me personally ) . course material was spread out through recorded lectures , ynchronous lectures and office hours so it was hard to know where to look for needed information . prof . vozny appeared unpraped for multiple lectures and did not explain material clearly . the course was heavy but very informativethe instruction was okay ay . both professors did a decent job in explaining concepts and going through problem calculations , which was challenging . alterations to the syllabus during the semester made the course a bit disorganized and confusing , but generally a decent course . the workload of this class is so overwhelming , and the labs are so different from what is being studied in the content at the time . itwould be more helpful if we were conducting labs that had to do with what we were currently learning . the marking schemes arefair for the most part ( for labs and writing assignments ) , but it was a lot of work throughout the semester . additionally , the professorswere posting so many videos , especially in the first half , and it became so overwhelming that there was (no) not time for anything else . this class should not split up into 3 separate hours , and if it is , it should be completely synchronous to give the students achance to ask questions on the spot . additionally , we should not rushing through concepts throughout the class just to fiteverything in . incorporating problems and showing the solutions to them made this a great course . course content was explained xwell and questions from students were answered during class . professor voznyy was excellent in providing practice questions and help to students for the understanding of concepts . on themidterm professor sullen ' s questions were quite difficult and some did not completely correlate to what was taught , however , shewas helpful during live lectures . the instructions regarding assignments and tests are detailed . there were (no) not assignments or any quizzes that we could have done helping us in the content of ruby ' s part of the course . althoughclutch existed , the problems were not diverse and ruby\xe2\x80\x93like as i expected them to be . i really admired my professors going through multiple practice problems as it allowed me to understand how to solve certainproblems , or problems similar to those . for future purposes , please release a document of practice problems and the answerswith steps on how to solve them . both professors were very helpful to students and did lots of practice questionsexcellentconcepts were explained relatively clearly and understandably . i liked how the lectures were synchronous , this allowed for questions to be clarified (without) not needing to wait for an email . as forassignments , they were fairly straightforward and easy to understand . the things that could improve could be the quality ofrecordings on prof . voznyy ' s end . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec60 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/8/2022 4/13commentsinstruction was clear and good . some lectures run long but that is fine . it was nice having the both a live part of the course while also knowing that if you could not attend , there would be a recording inwhich you could watch . so you would feel as though there was not much you would be missing . the quality of instruction in this course was good between both professors teaching it . they do a good job at trying to explain hardconcepts clearly , and provide lecture slides for students to maximize the amount of information that we have at our disposal . overall , he instruction in this course relative to the material was good . i found the overall quality good . the profs and the tas were helpful . the lectures were useful and the office hours provided deeperunderstanding of the course material . the amount of effort the profs spent into lectures and office hours is admirable . 8 .
