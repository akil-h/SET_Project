so sweet and everything she says makes sensegreat.professor nirusha explains all the concepts very clearly. the peer instructions allow us to apply what we have learnedand they are very helpful.it was a great course and i look forward to be taught by prof. nirusha again!very goodvery goodthe labs were hard for many people generally the experimental portion was muvh harder.the course itself is amazing, the information presented is wonderful for those who have had a background in chemistry.i would just like to say that maybe there should be an introductory course (similar to bioa11) for those who would like tolearn more about chemistry but do not have the necessary background in order to exceldr.thavarah was an amazing chemistry professor, who truly cares about her students. her peer instructions wererevolutionary, in the sense that they engaged critical thinking within the classroom\xcd\xbe something not commonly done byother university professors. he taught at a steady pace, which allowed for students to understand the course material.professor nirusha was a very good instructor, she explained all concepts very clearly and she was very patient withanswering all questions. she genuinely wanted all her students to do very well in the course.amazing,it was excellent. couldn't have asked for a better first year chemistry course. i love the interactive learning and nirushais a very knowledgable and helpful instructor.it was good except the quizzes during practical was pretty confusing.the prof explained new concepts and had plenty of practice questions that helped strengthen the knowledge of theseconcepts. the teaching style did not cater to all types of people but the prof did a great job at clarifying confusingmaterial.pretty goods, evaluations were very fair, lectures were very engaginglecture really taught very well.nirusha explains everything very clearly. she is a very knowledgeable professor, and is easy to approach to. sheteaches in steady pace to make sure everyone understands the concept, and gives lots of examples and makes thelectures engaging.everything was explained in deep detail which better prepared us for the exam.did an amazing job teaching the content in class with a great mix of practice problems and lecturing.the content was well presented however the method in which she presented the knowledge was unclear and causedmass confusion, at times.i think the content was easy to understand however the midterm did display some difficulty as it the classes did notfocus much on the questions asked on the evaluation.well organized, the instructor knows the material well and explains it clearly.very interesting and very well taughtat the beginning the course was great however, towards the end the material was not clearly explained.pretty clear, labs were fun and informativen/athe professor did an excellent job covering the course materialprofessor thavarajah was excellent at giving lectures, she motivated me to learn, and is excellent at explaining coursematerial. however, sometimes the lab material could be a little bit confusing\xcd\xbe specifically discerning what we weretasked with in the report sheets.the course was challenging for me at times, however as someone who is not particularly interested in chemistry, i didquite well and found some material interesting.introductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/4/20174/17   commentsit was okthis course provided a good understanding of the material required. the lectures aligned nicely with the textbook'scontent, allowing the student to clearly understand the concepts.she is the best at taking itme to eplain concepts and knows when to slow down for students to catch upthe quality of instruction for labs were very poor, many of the quizzes and report sheets were not clear in what it wasasking for, therefore many were not doing good in the lab component of this course.it was a pretty difficult course for me, but i learned a lot from it so the headaches were worth it.i enjoyed the option of being able to watch the lectures online and in\xe2\x80\x93person. also, the peer instruction segmentsencourage to keep up with the course material and clarify some misunderstandings that i might've had beforehand.the instructions in this course were little unclear but overall okayi enjoyed this course in that there were many concepts that were intriguing and the instructor truly enjoyed the contentshe was teaching. his helped to engage me in the course along with the peer instructionsthe course was okprofessor nirusha is excellent. the peer class assessment portions of her lectures allowed me to become deeplyengaged in the course content while providing me a greater understanding of the subject material. the lecture contentwas informative and highly engaging.dr. thavarajah is a knowledgeable and able instructor. however, the flow of the course is really quite slow, which provedvery frustrating to me.professor thavarajah is very helpful and is always eager to help. she has helped me a great deal with how to managemy time and with a lot of the course content. she is an amazing professor.i absolutely love chemistry and i feel that professor thavarajah elevates the subject to a whole new level. she ispassionate about the topics taught in class, she takes the time to go through examples and explain how one dissects aproblem and answers it using the principles of chemistry being taught in class, and she cares about our learning whichis why she does peer instruction questions. she is knowledgeable about the material and creates a warm, welcoming,and happy learning environment for every student in this course. she is probably the most human of all the professorsi've had so far as she is not condescending, nor egotistical. instead, she teaches with passion and humility and love forthe subject of chemistry\xcd\xbe which is a great reflection on the students as it makes us want to do the same.the labs (practicals) were unrelated to the material being taught in the lecture around the 2\xe2\x80\x93week period of the labstaking place.the course was interesting however, the lab pre\xe2\x80\x93quizzes were worth too much as it was worth almost the same as thelab report. the peer instructions provided discussion and interactive learning throughout.very straightforward and engaging. the opportunities provided in class to practice the material helped a lot incementing the concepts learned.this course was good i liked doing examples in class which helped my in understanding the concepts togetheri loved the profthe classes really got us involved and labs sometimes being hard but were a great learning experience.labs are very low quality in terms of engagement and relevance to the ongoing lecture materialdr thavarajah is patient and helpful. her efforts do not go unnoticed as she encourages students to excel in classthis course was really well taught! i really found mastering chemistry assignments and the peer instructions (in thelectures) helped me better understand the content as we are applying what we know to the question we are solving. forthis course i truly found my self learning and expanding my knowledge! :di found difficulty understanding some of the material and felt new concepts were not explained thoroughly.i found that the instructor was good at explaining conceptsthis course was great because it developed my understanding of chemistrythe instruction was done by only 1 professor which was helpful as the method of teaching didn't change throughout thesemester, also the questions during classes test my basic abilities and allow me to fill in gaps that i may have missed.this course is great because of professor thavarajah. she provides excellent instruction, making the lecturesinteractive and stimulating and also challenges the class.the lecture portion of this course is fine, professor thavarajah explains the concepts clearly. the instruction on the labintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/4/20175/17   commentscomponent is rather clear from the lab manual, however, it was rather overwhelming for first year students, with theamount of tasks required to complete in 1 lab session.honestly, i do not think professor thavarajah could do a better job at teaching. she really covers all topics in lecturesand is always willing to help. she is very encouraging and you can tell that she truly wants her students to succeed.overall, good course, and good instructors.she is patient but somehow with too many peer exercise.i was able to learn a lot. peer instructions and sample problems were really insightful and put a lot of concepts togetherto help me understand.good in class application of knowledge, sometimes confusing even after explination, unsure on what equations wouldbe necessarythis professor is amazing! i never understood chemistry as well as i do right now!dr. thavarajah was extremely concerned with my learning, looking for every opportunity to make the content beunderstood easier, she explains concepts very well, but not so difficult that it would give me a hard time to understand.she goes very fast during the lectures, and sometimes i find it hard to keep up so i don't go in class anymore but theamount she puts in the lectures are fair and her tests are nothing we've never seen before.i love ow she gives sample questions and peer instructions that are not all easy!very clear at teaching, great teachingdr thavarajah went at a good pace. i liked how she always explained everything thoroughly.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good. i liked how the professor gave in class examples thatshe would take up.i didn't find the lectures necessary to attend as they didn't really help my learning.clear and good.the lectures were paced a little too slowly in my opinion, but this provided an opportunity for extensive reading and agreat understanding of the content.lectures gave a great understanding of the course.the instructor is patient and knowledgeable, so even though the class material is somewhat hard i still manage tograsp it.the professor always takes the time to explain concepts thoroughly, even if no one asked about it, a good thing sincemany students are afraid to ask for helpexcellent teaching with patience. explains things clearly and is enthusiatic all the time. she is amazingdr nirusha taught extremely well. however i feel as if the lab quizzes are a bit too hard, they should go easy on the labsas it should be more learning and hands on then focusing on just the quiz which is a great portion of your mark.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was good.material was well paced, instructor was organized and clear. while the practice questions in\xe2\x80\x93class are useful, a fewless may allow for material to be more spread out/more material covered instead of waiting to take up solutions to allthe problems.instructions were always clear & concise, never afraid to answer questions that students hadi loved the way nirusha taught the course and explained information during lectures.professor thavarajah is a very patient and understanding professor. i think that the way she explained answers and theway to get answers to a question were simple so that every student could understand the concepts applied during thequestion. the midterm was very fair as well, as i was able to understand all the questions and the mistakes i madewere due to lack of studying on my part. also, the peer instruction questions were super helpful in order to help meunderstand the concepts and how to apply them. their difficulty allowed me to really think questions through andpractice good test taking skills.the professor explains each topic thoroughly.goodhard to keep up with all the materialvery good!introductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/4/20176/17   commentsthe professor for this course is absolutely inspirational and makes me love to learn.dr. nirusha has allowed me to see chemistry in a new light. i can now better understand the concepts especially withher peer instructions questions.it was really really good. i enjoyed chemistryi did not take the grade 12 in chemistry in high school. this is why this course is somewhat challenging for mecomparing to the other students. there is however very big engagement of our professor in both lectures and officehours, we can go and meet her with every problem. fsg sessions are also very important part of this course. there is alot of practice what is also very helpful in studying.she explained topic thoroughly and gave a lot of examples but sometimes went through topics very quickly so i wouldsometimes get lostit was greatvery clearit was a good course, we went through the material at a fair pace and all concepts were well covered and lots of time ofpractice questions in class, which really helped me see the application of equations and conceptsi loved the peer instruction questions. they are extremely helpful and allows me to understand the course content to adeeper degree.each topic discussed during lectures were taught in a good manner. i was able to comprehend a majority of thematerial through lectures alone. this is completed/enhanced by the assignments on masteringchemistryi love nirusha she makes me love chem!our professor went through the material at very comfortable pace and thoroughly discussed it. i feel like this coursegave me a higher understanding of the topics i learned in high school.the instruction in the course was excellent as the professor as well as the tas were amazing in guiding the studentsand helping them learn and understand the concepts as well as lab material.it was okay.amazing teacher. really inspires you with her knowledge and instills confidence in each and every one of

with either the ta(s)or the instructor them self.nirusha was so helpful! i went to her office hours and she made sure i understood before leavingthere was a lot of assistance available in this course

chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/4/201710/17   ""","b "" amazing , so sweet and everything she says makes sensegreat . professor nirusha explains all the concepts very clearly . the peer instructions allow us to apply what we have learnedand they are very helpful . it was a great course and i look forward to be taught by prof . nirusha again ! very goodvery goodthe labs were hard for many people generally the experimental portion was muvh harder . the course itself is amazing , the information presented is wonderful for those who have had a background in chemistry . i would just like to say that maybe there should be an introductory course ( similar to bioa11 ) for those who would like tolearn more about chemistry but do not necessary background in order to exceldr . thavarah was an amazing chemistry professor , who truly cares about her students . her peer instructions wererevolutionary , in the xsense that they engaged critical thinking within the classroom\xcd\xbe something not commonly done byother university professors . he taught at a steady pace , which allowed for students to understand the course material . professor nirusha was a very good instructor , she explained all concepts very clearly and she was very patient withanswering all questions . she genuinely wanted all her students to do very xwell in the course . amazing , t was excellent . could not asked for a better first year chemistry course . i love the interactive learning and nirushais a very knowledgable and helpful instructor . it was good except the quizzes during practical was pretty confusing . the prof explained new concepts and had plenty of practice questions that helped strengthen the knowledge of theseconcepts . the teaching style did not cater to all types of people but the prof did a great job at clarifying confusingmaterial . pretty goods , evaluations were very fair , lectures were very engaginglecture really taught very well . nirusha explains everything very clearly . she is a very knowledgeable professor , and is easy to approach to . sheteaches in steady pace to make sure everyone understands the concept , and gives lots of examples and makes thelectures engaging . everything was explained in deep detail which better prepared us for the exam . did an amazing job teaching the content in class with a great mix of practice problems and lecturing . the content was well presented however the method in which she presented the knowledge was unclear and causedmass confusion , at times . i think the content was easy to understand however the midterm did display some difficulty as it the classes did notfocus much on the questions asked on the evaluation . well organized , the instructor knows the material well and explains it clearly . very interesting and very well taughtat the beginning the course was great however , towards the end the material was not clearly explained . pretty clear , labs were fun and informativen/athe professor did an excellent job covering the course materialprofessor thavarajah was excellent at giving lectures , she motivated me to learn , and is excellent at explaining coursematerial . however , sometimes the lab material could be a xlittle bit confusing\xcd\xbe specifically discerning what we weretasked with in the report sheets . the course was challenging for me at times , however as someone who is not particularly interested in chemistry , i didquite well and found some material interesting . introductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/4/20174/17 commentsit was okay this course provided a good understanding of the material required . the lectures aligned nicely with the textbook ' scontent , allowing the student to clearly understand the concepts . she is the best at taking itme to eplain concepts and knows when to slow down for students to catch upthe quality of instruction for labs were very poor , many of the quizzes and report sheets were not clear in what it wasasking for , therefore many were not good in the lab component of this course . it was a pretty difficult course for me , but i learned a lot from it so the headaches were worth it . i enjoyed the option of being able to watch the lectures online and in\xe2\x80\x93person . also , the peer instruction segmentsencourage to keep up with the course material and clarify some misunderstandings that i might have had beforehand . the instructions in this course were (little) not unclear but overall okay ayi enjoyed this course in that there were many concepts that were intriguing and the instructor truly enjoyed the contentshe was teaching . his helped to engage me in the course along with the peer instructionsthe course was okay professor nirusha is excellent . the peer class assessment portions of her lectures allowed me to become deeplyengaged in the course content while providing me a greater understanding of the subject material . the lecture contentwas informative and highly engaging . dr . thavarajah is a knowledgeable and able instructor . however , the flow of the course is really quite slow , which provedvery frustrating to me . professor thavarajah is very helpful and is always eager to help . she has helped me a xgreat deal with how to managemy time and with a lot of the course content . she is an amazing professor . i absolutely love chemistry and i feel that professor thavarajah elevates the subject to a whole new level . she ispassionate about the topics taught in class , she takes the time to go through examples and explain how one dissects aproblem and answers it using the principles of chemistry being taught in class , and she cares about our learning whichis why she does peer instruction questions . she is knowledgeable about the material and creates a warm , welcoming , nd happy learning environment for every student in this course . she is probably the most human of all the professorsi have had so far as she is not condescending , (nor) not egotistical . instead , she teaches with passion and humility and love forthe subject of chemistry\xcd\xbe which is a great reflection on the students as it makes us want to do the same . the labs ( practicals ) were unrelated to the material being taught in the lecture around the 2\xe2\x80\x93week period of the labstaking place . the course was interesting however , the lab pre\xe2\x80\x93quizzes were worth too xmuch as it was worth almost the same as thelab report . the peer instructions provided discussion and interactive learning throughout . very straightforward and engaging . the opportunities provided in class to practice the material helped a lot incementing the concepts learned . this course was good i liked doing examples in class which helped my in understanding the concepts togetheri loved the profthe classes really got us involved and labs sometimes being hard but were a great learning experience . labs are very low quality in terms of engagement and relevance to the ongoing lecture materialdr thavarajah is patient and helpful . her efforts do not unnoticed as she encourages students to excel in classthis course was really well taught ! i really found mastering chemistry assignments and the peer instructions ( in thelectures ) helped me better understand the content as we are applying what we know to the question we are solving . forthis course i truly found my self learning and expanding my knowledge ! : di found difficulty understanding some of the material and felt new concepts were not explained thoroughly . i found that the instructor was good at explaining conceptsthis course was great because it developed my understanding of chemistrythe instruction was done by only 1 professor which was helpful as the method of teaching did not change throughout thesemester , also the questions during classes test my basic abilities and allow me to fill in gaps that i may have missed . this course is great because of professor thavarajah . she provides excellent instruction , making the lecturesinteractive and stimulating and also challenges the class . the lecture portion of this course is fine , professor thavarajah explains the concepts clearly . the instruction on the labintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/4/20175/17 commentscomponent is rather clear from the lab manual , however , it was rather overwhelming for first year students , with theamount of tasks required to complete in 1 lab session . honestly , i do not think professor thavarajah could do a better job at teaching . she really covers all topics in lecturesand is always willing to help . she is very encouraging and you can tell that she truly wants her students to succeed . overall , good course , and good instructors . she is patient but somehow with too xmany peer exercise . i was able to learn a lot . peer instructions and sample problems were really insightful and put a lot of concepts togetherto help me understand . good in class application of knowledge , sometimes confusing even after explination , unsure on what equations wouldbe necessarythis professor is amazing ! i (never) not understood chemistry as xwell as i do right now ! dr . thavarajah was extremely concerned with my learning , looking for every opportunity to make the content beunderstood easier , she explains concepts very xwell but not difficult that it would give me a hard time to understand . she goes very fast during the lectures , and sometimes i find it hard to keep up so i do not in class anymore but theamount she puts in the lectures are fair and her tests are (nothing) not we have (never) not seen before . i love ow she gives sample questions and peer instructions that are not easy ! very clear at teaching , great teachingdr thavarajah went at a good pace . i liked how she always explained everything thoroughly . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good . i liked how the professor gave in class examples thatshe would take up . i did not find the lectures necessary to attend as they did not help my learning . clear and good . the lectures were paced a xlittle too xslowly in my opinion , but this provided an opportunity for extensive reading and agreat understanding of the content . lectures gave a great understanding of the course . the instructor is patient and knowledgeable , so even though the class material is somewhat hard i still manage tograsp it . the professor always takes the time to explain concepts thoroughly , even if (no_one) not asked about it , a good thing sincemany students are afraid to ask for helpexcellent teaching with patience . explains things clearly and is enthusiatic all the time . she is amazingdr nirusha taught extremely well . however i feel as if the lab quizzes are a bit too xhard , they should go easy on the labsas it should be more learning and hands on then focusing on just the quiz which is a great portion of your mark . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was good . material was well paced , instructor was organized and clear . while the practice questions in\xe2\x80\x93class are useful , a fewless may allow for material to be more spread out/more material covered instead of waiting to take up solutions to allthe problems . instructions were always clear & concise , (never) not afraid to answer questions that students hadi loved the way nirusha taught the course and explained information during lectures . professor thavarajah is a very patient and understanding professor . i think that the way she explained answers and theway to get answers to a question were simple so that every student could understand the concepts applied during thequestion . the midterm was very fair as xwell as i was able to understand all the questions and the mistakes i madewere due to lack xof xstudying on my part . also , the peer instruction questions were super helpful in order to help meunderstand the concepts and how to apply them . their difficulty allowed me to really think questions through andpractice good test taking skills . the professor explains each topic thoroughly . goodhard to keep up with all the materialvery good ! introductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/4/20176/17 commentsthe professor for this course is absolutely inspirational and makes me love to learn . dr . nirusha has allowed me to see chemistry in a new light . i can now better understand the concepts especially withher peer instructions questions . it was really really good . i enjoyed chemistryi did not grade 12 in chemistry in high school . this is why this course is somewhat challenging for mecomparing to the other students . there is however very big engagement of our professor in both lectures and officehours , we can go and meet her with every problem . fsg sessions are also very important part of this course . there is alot of practice what is also very helpful in studying . she explained topic thoroughly and gave a lot of examples but sometimes went through topics very quickly so i wouldsometimes get lostit was greatvery clearit was a good course , we went through the material at a fair pace and all concepts were well covered and lots of time ofpractice questions in class , which really helped me see the application of equations and conceptsi loved the peer instruction questions . they are extremely helpful and allows me to understand the course content to adeeper degree . each topic discussed during lectures were taught in a good manner . i was able to comprehend a majority of thematerial through lectures alone . this is completed/enhanced by the assignments on masteringchemistryi love nirusha she makes me love chem ! our professor went through the material at very comfortable pace and thoroughly discussed it . i feel xlike this coursegave me a higher understanding of the topics i learned in high school . the instruction in the course was excellent as the professor as xwell as the tas were amazing in guiding the studentsand helping them learn and understand the concepts as xwell as lab material . it was okay ay . amazing teacher . really inspires you with her knowledge and instills confidence in each and every one of her students . the course was taught wellthe instructors were very good with the instructions and getting all the material across8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your

assistance available support learn thiscourse","b""i like the practice questions that the professor gives us. i think there should be a tutorial or something to help out withlab reports.fair quality, some topics could've been better explainedokayshe was really nice and inviting. it made me want to come back to the lectures just to see what i could learn .the professor clearly explained the materials in a pace where everything can be understood, making it easier tounderstand the coursedid a great job at explaining concepts and making sure everyone or majority of the class understood before proceedingto the next lecture/lessons. always attempted to clear up any confusion or unclear matter about the content.the peer instruction was always really helpful and the extra assignments allowed me to better understand the material.people really love to talk in this class which was distracting a lot, so maybe just say something to people like thatinstead of speaking over them.very engaging and the professor explained concepts and theories so well i was able to understand them even thoughin high school i had difficulty understanding them. it just shows how great instructions help me understand things.i love nirusha. she is such an amazing teacher! i wish i had her as my teacher for all 4 years. her way of teaching isexcellent... she's very patient, motherly and comforting. her lectures are very entertaining and i'm so grateful to have heras our instructor for chma10 only if she was my teacher next sem too :(lab section was not the best, unfairly marked (for me at least). lectures were okay. not the best i've had but that couldjust be my general disinterest in the field. mastering chem was a useful learning tool.instruction was very good. professor t. was always very helpful and clear.great.the quality of the instruction of this course was really good and provided with all the skills necessary to succeed inchemistry b\xe2\x80\x93courses.the overall quality of this course was good but the content was a week after the first week labs which was hard sincethe content from my lab was taught after my lab was overgoodalthough professors voice was too soothing, and it put me to sleepi love professor nirusha's lectures. the way she teaches the content makes it very understandable for meshe has all the criteria for being a perfect instructor. she tries to make students understand concepts unlike otherinstructors. peer instruction was incredibly productive for enhancing my understanding of chem. hope see prof.thavarajah in the upcoming courses.lectures were quite good, dr. thavarajah explains things very clearly and has lots of examples to show how to apply theteachings. dr. thavarajah clearly cares about learning (peer instruction, tons of optional online questions) so that thestudents fully understand the concepts. much of the labs are repeats of previous high school labs, which is nice to easeinto doing labs again, but i would have liked to see some labs that were a bit different.best professor. instruction was great.after the mid\xe2\x80\x93term, i have gotten very lazy with this course. the encouragement to study was not there and i would notcare a lot of what the instructor had to say.the materials covered in class were well defined and deeply elaborated.the prof was amazing. she made sure that students understood the material!very helpful and very kind. she cares about her students.\xe2\x80\x93lectures were informative and peer instruction allowed students to effectively apply skillsthe overall quality of the instruction of this course was very clear and easy to understood as the instructor were informus what is due and what are the important concepts in each chapter.it was clear what the wanted and they helped us to understand chemistry better by creating an interactive environmentduring lectures.12/4/20174/19   commentslectures were littered with examples that helped to iron out my understanding of details and intricacies required toachieve satisfaction.no complaints. lectures moved a bit fast, note taking was hardthe processor was very clear and easy understand. she made the course material easier to understand even though itwas difficult.ms.thavarajah clearly explains concepts and questions and show a clear concern for the wellbeing of her students.goodit was very enjoyable, and was able to learn most in this subject.professor explained topics effectively in lectures. the peer instructions were also great, as they allowed me tounderstand the topic more.excellentthe explanations and calculations were very thorough.i was so grateful to have professor nirusha thavarajah as my professor this semester. extremely knowledgable in hersubject but also a great educator that truly cares about your progress and understanding of the material. i hope to beable to have her again as a professor!!the overall quality of the instruction in this course is outstanding. professor thavarajah is an great professor. she goteveryone in the class involved and she really knows what she is talking about. she has done an excellent job gettingthe lessons through to everyone.professor went at a pace of understanding, took time to help with student difficulties, very clear on what we need toknow and takes concepts outside to real world problems. provided an atmosphere of learning, engaging with others.took time to help those who seemed assisance and genuinely concerned with student success. helped ensure thatstudents were not intimidated by content and that ensured students felt comfortable with content as a group.very good!the prof was amazing at explaining the key concepts of all units and really wanted us to understand everything beforemoving oni honestly don't like chemistry at all but the instructor is very good and friendly making the experience more tolerable.lectures contained content that was explained clearly and allowed students to think and complete practice questions.the instruction in this course was of high quality since professor thavarajah took time during the lecture to go throughthe questions step by step which allowed me to solidify my understanding of the conceptsvery good instructor. she explains everything clearly and helps out when you have questions. i like the peer instruction.excellent and very interactiveit is great to have a professor who is very organized and provides many opportunities to practice the concepts taught.the professor was highly knowledgeable in every field covered and explained things very clearly and easily. the coursedifficulty was average and the labs were very helpful in reinforcing concepts.goodthe in\xe2\x80\x93class lectures were incredible learning experiences. in using peer instruction as well as encouragingparticipation, dr. t was able to help me to better understand the course and related material. i felt extremely preparedfor my exams in this course and i have dr. t to thank for that. dr. t really cared about our learning and understanding ofthe course materials.our professor is amazing, she explains the material very clearly. answers all of our questions and is always there tohelp.nirusha is the greatest. prof of the f**kin year. legit, her peer instructions, learning environment, theengagement, the way she breaks concepts down and ensures that she does her best to make sure every studentunderstands it, oh man great prof. honestly, nirusha is a gem to utsc. i was extremely surprised to even know suchan amazing prof exists. the fact that everything she teaches sticks to my head when i get home is amazing. lovely,warm and welcoming prof. aside from that, a great representation of how teaching should be done. words just cantdescribe her amazing teaching abilities and her care for each student's well being. best prof ever.overall quality of instruction helped me in increasing my knowledge of material however i think marking scheme for labcould have been improved as quizzes only tested on pre lab knowledge and lab assignments were majority of mark12/4/20175/19   commentshowever other than 2 marks for safety there was no actual marks given for the way the lab was performedit was easy to understand and interesting to learn. the professor was really good and communicating with students,and motivate students. the content covers a lot but most of it can be learned during lecture time. it was easy to follow theinstructor.excellent notes! and explantation by the prof!prof nirusha is the best professor ever. she engages the class and make it lively. helps students very much andmakes sure that we understand i hope to have her again in other chem classes in the futurethe quality of the instruction in this course is very good. the professor went through each concept and disciplines witha wide degree of effectiveness providing exceptional teachinggood instruction. nirusha should move around more when teachingbest profit was okprofessor did well delivering the content loved she did practice questions in class.i really liked the peer instruction questions. i found them very helpful as to remembering and learning to apply theconcept learned. i found this course interesting.the professor explains things very clearly in class and is very helpfuli found this course very well organized and many tools were available to help us succeed. however, in the future, itwould be helpful if the pre class notes had the peer questions as well. i found that switching from printed notes to anotebook disruptive when studying. if the questions (blank/unanswered) were provided in the prelecture notes, i wouldbe able to print them and write all my notes in the same place. this would also be beneficial because when we aresolving those questions in class, we would have a copy in front of us and not be so focused on copying down thequestion posted on the lecture screen (as we know that these questions will only be posted once the chapter is over,which can be several lectures later which does not help when trying to figure out those questions after the lecture if wedid not get the chance to solve it on our own). also it appeared as though we always ran out of time for the more difficultquestion, perhaps structure the lecture so that we have more time to work on those last few questions at the end ofeach lecture.goodthe pre and post lecture notes can be released at the same time before the course. it is not necessary to hide theanswers.information was very well and the peer instructions were helpful.generally it's very good ,teaching with details and providing questions to engage us to study during class time.\xe2\x80\x93i like how for every concept there is a sample problem and then a peer instruction question to further improve yourunderstanding of the concept. as well i like how there are also challenge problems involved.nirusha was a great professor to have.i really enjoyed the way our instructor went over previous days lecture and combined and connected different materialsso we can see the bigger picture.the course was rather dense at times. definitely the hardest course i am enrolled in.the instruction was amazing, and helped me better my understanding on the various topicsthe overall quality of instruction was good.i wish there was a little more time to copy down the slides(not everything, just when there are sample problems or peerinstructions).the prof taught the material very well.the course was very well taught by the instructor. dr thavarajah explained the material very well and provided greatfeedback as to how we can improve in the coming evaluations.i enjoyed the peer evaluations that was put up during lectures.professor n explained concepts clearly and the peer learning activities as well as pre/post lecture assignments werevery helpful to check if taught materials was being understood.great experiencethe quality of the instruction in this course was good12/4/20176/19   commentsgood course. hard to follow because it is a little fast paced considering this is my poor subject area.the instructor (nirusha thavarajah) is a excellent professor as she explains with great care and detail the concepts tobe learned .ms. nirusha thavarajah is one of the most amazing professors! i really like this class. she teaches and explains verywell. even though the content is detailed, she makes it easier for us to understand by teaching the core concepts.the instructor took the time to explain the concepts properly. between lectures, she would make students try outquestions relating to the topic being taught. while the students were answering the questions, the instructor would walkaround and offer her assistance to students.prof thavarajah's lectures were well laid out and easy to follow. they corresponded exactly to the textbook, thus makingher lectures insignificant as they only followed material as exactly laid out on the slides and in the textbook. as an onlinestudent, watching the lectures was pointless as they were less helpful than just reading the textbook and doing practiceproblems from there. the content covered in the course was complete and it was easy to study for exams, with nosurprises, as the professor had very competent and helpful exam reviews.professor thavarajah is an outstanding professor. she conveys information and answers questions with clarity, sheexplains concepts with sufficient detail using enhanced visuals, and she allows us to apply our learning in real\xe2\x80\x93lifeapplication problems. her notes are organized and relatively easy to follow and she addresses all our concerns toease the pressure of exams. she always finds a way to personally relate chemistry to us, and as a result, we share adeeper passion for this subject.i really enjoyed the lectures as well as a laboratory component. instruction was very clear and stimulating. a very goodpace was maintained and explanations were very clear.lecture notes are good, especially when you come to lecture, the course was very interestingthe classes were okay, but i wish there was more of an in\xe2\x80\x93depth explanation of most of the content. the labs were horrible, my ta wasn't that helpful sometimes.dr. nirusha creates a wonderful learning environment and really encourages stimulating class discussions. throughlyenjoyed learning from her.goodgood! i like this course!she was a fine professor initiated questions like peer\xe2\x80\x93instructions which really made us think and helped us.it is preyty nice since our prof has always provided peer instructions that can help us think about the course materialsand provide a better understanding of the materials in the questions.prof nirusha provided a positive environment to learn in. she included may critical thinking question (peer\xe2\x80\x93instruction)that made student engage and connect many connection of different topics together.mrs. nirusha, enlightened and educated us, in a fun, interactive manner.was pretty good, fast at times but thats something to expect at universityi was able to grasp the knowledge presented in class easily.8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse.""","b""commentsmastering chemistrysomewhat okayfsgsmasterchemistry helped with the

professor gives us . i think there should be a tutorial or something to help out withlab reports . fair quality , some topics could have been better explainedokayshe was really nice and inviting . it made me want to come back to the lectures just to see what i could learn . the professor clearly explained the materials in a pace where everything can be understood , making it easier tounderstand the coursedid a great job at explaining concepts and making sure everyone or majority of the class understood before proceedingto the next lecture/lessons . always attempted to clear up any confusion or unclear matter about the content . the peer instruction was always really helpful and the extra assignments allowed me to better understand the material . people really love to talk in this class which was distracting a lot , so maybe just say something to people like thatinstead of speaking over them . very engaging and the professor explained concepts and theories so well i was able to

additionalinformation available textbook please comment assistance available support learn thiscourse","b'excellentthe instructors were great, and had an obvious goal of improving student learning and understanding.i just found that it was a very slow paced course. the topics are things that were covered previously in high school andthe pace at which it was being (re) taught was painful.i just wished it was taught faster which would\'ve made the experience more stimulating.in fact, chma11 and chma10 are complete reviews of gr12 materials and i feel that both courses could have beencombined into one and offered in the fall. we did not need to spend half a semester doing stoichiometry, gas laws,imfs, etc; those could\'ve been taught in a week.if both courses were combined then that gives us the freedom to undertake a second year chemistry course (ex organicchem) in the winter semester which would further reduce our course load in second year.i honestly didn\'t feel as if i needed to put any effort into these courses, partly because the instructors were amazing inexplaining concepts, but mostly because i spent a year in high school learning the same things.amazing professors and great slides and notes from both of them.it was hard to follow the instructing styles of the professors.both instructors were amazing at teaching the material. they were able to explain concepts well clearly.dr. wania and dr. thavarajah did an amazing job and giving clear and concise explanations for the content that neededto be covered. though dr. wania was a great professor, i always look forward to going to dr. thavarajah\'s lectures asshe is very engaging and really understands what students struggle with and can easily pinpoint the issues studentshave. yes i made a mistake, but also, i\'m a first year student who just came from highschool, i am allowed to make mistakes, you do not need to rub it in.the material being taught in the class was very well understood as the professor taught every lecture. quality of theinformation taught was clear and good for people to understand with students being able to use that knowledge in thefuture.good!i had a hard time following professor wania during lecture. his writing was hard to understand and he would either govery slow or very fast on a topic. i did not enjoy going to class often. i liked how professor thavarajah gave usopportunities to work through the problems as a class. it helped me learn the information much faster.dr. wania\'s handwritten note-taking method was different and unique. dr. thavarajah was extremely helpful as sheprovided us with in-class opportunities to solidify learning. this included in-class sample questions.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good because the instruction was detailed and includedexamples to help me understand the course concepts. the instruction included sample problems which allowed me totest myself and to determine how much i understood the course concepts. the instruction could be improved byincluding more of these sample problems, particularly in the first half of the course.nirusha thavarajah has great teaching skills; simplifying the problem matter in an easy understandable wayfrank wania\'s teaching skills were very helpful as well. taking up problem sets together and in a step-by-step processmade further studying easierlabs were the most stressful component of the course. in fact, myself and most of my acquaintances would argue that ittakes away from our learning time b/c of how demanding labs are (pre lab/ post lab stuff, quizzes worth too much, etc.)very draining.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was good.the peer questions and other examples that were integrated in the lectures were very helpful in making me apply thisknowledge which led to a deeper understanding of the concept.the labs tend to be very rushed and stressful. this is not really conducive to learning. longer lab sections with thesame experiments would actually be preferable. the lectures are somewhat unengaging although informative.there was a big difference in the way the two prof\'s taught. wania used markers and a overhead to get concepts whilenirusha with her powerpoints and quick pair and share. as soon as people got used to wania, the prof switched andthen it became harder for i, personally, to cope with the material.while i appreciate the professor wanting students to work through examples in class i feel like the class time spentwaiting for the class to finish the exercise could have been used for other things.   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 5/13a lot of examples were provided, which promotes the quality of the instruction because concrete applications are given.i enjoyed all the lectures and even labs this semester.both profs provided sufficient information for most assignments.for the first module with frank wania, i found it very difficult to keep up to the pace he was teaching. he didn\'t providevery neat and organized notes (they were handwritten with sloppy writing) and most of the time i had to re-watchlecturecasts to figure out what certain words meant. it was a horrible way of teaching for me personally. he basicallyjust told people what he was about to write, wrote it, and didn\'t discuss why or how he got to his answers.different ways of teaching were demonstrates.i feel like the labs could have been better timed with the content being learned in lecturedr thavarajah\'s teaching style was wonderful. i always understood what she was teaching. dr wania\'s method ofteaching was sometimes hard to follow.very informative lectures. however, the lab experience was terrible. i think that ta\'s should mark fairly for all practicalsand for all students. if two students submit the sheets, one ta would give 100\'s, while another would give 50\'s and 60\'sall for the same content. this drastically affects grades and creates an inequitable lab-grading system. either the ta\'sshould be more laid back when marking, or be nitty-gritty; they should all be the same when marking. veryunsatisfactory grades from the lab component. on the positive note, the lectures are very informative and delivered verywell!this course allows students to acknowledge the many different types of activities occurring on a daily basis.great profs. lectures were full of information and sample questions to improve understanding. labs were good withsome variety of experiments conducted. overall great course, learned a lot.i really enjoyed how dr. wania wrote the notes in class. it brought him down to the student level, and made it easy tofollow and not discourage us with a bunch of notes that were prepared before hand. i also enjoyed how he explainedthings thoroughly to begin, and then wrote down what he just explained. it gave me the opportunity to learn it twice. whati really enjoyed about dr. tharavajah\'s teaching style is the in class questions she posed us and then thoroughlywalked through the solution, making it clear what concepts were being applied, and how to answer questions related tothese topics. overall the instruction in this course was well above average.the use of peer instructions were really helpful for understanding the concepts of the course (particularly during thesecond module).the labs were fun and interesting. i liked being able to work with my peers as well as on my own. lectures were goodand stimulating. students encouraged to participate during lectures. masteringchem is a great way of practice.labs are stressful. the clocks in the lab i was working in actually work this semester, which means we know the timenow, but rushing and messing stuff up to get the lab finished before the lab period is over is not helpful. the labs didhave to do with what we were learning in lecture, which is a lot better than last semester. for me at least, having thelabs use what we were learning in the lectures meant i actually knew what to do for the prelab. labs are still stressful.for the actual lectures...professor w. wrote his notes by hand during the lecture, which meant i could actually keep upwith what he was teaching us. for professor t\'s lectures i sometimes come out without any notes. i\'m next to uselessat the practice questions she has us do during the lecture because i\'m not wasting notebook paper on working themout. spending all lecture on practice questions is really helpful and a waste of time, if that makes any sense. helpfulbecause we\'re given an idea of the type of questions we might have to do, and a waste of time because we\'re notactually being taught anything.wania was a great prof but as the course progressed, the quality of his notes and lectures were decreasingsignificantly. nirusha was amazing as always, very clear and helpful with many though provoking questions that assista great deal with understand even the most difficult conceptsdr. wania was very good at making complex concepts easier to understand with interesting examples and stimulatinglectures.goodit was good. clear, easy to understand and thoroughi personally struggle a great deal with chemistry, so my response may not be of good use. i think that the instructionwas well-done, although fast, and if students give proper attention they can learn quite a lot in one year about chemistry.frank wania\'s section moved very slowly and it was quite hard to pay attention due to his methods.the overall quality was goodwas okgreat!good, love the way professor nirusha gives a lot of example questions during class which helps immensely with   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 6/13understanding the concepts.professor nirusha\'s intruction methods were the most beneficial or easy to understandingwhen frank was teaching the course i thought it was very helpful learning the course when he does example questionson the powerpoint. it allows us the focus more in class and to fully understand the material as we write what he writes.as for nirusha\'s teaching, it was very helpful as well because i thought her powerpoint notes were well descriptive anddetailed.frank at times made it difficult to understand the content, providing us with examples that were difficult to understand.he also expected us to know certain material that most students, including myself, have never learned in the past. henever took the time to explain it, and was not very approachable.nirusha was excellent when it came to delivering content. she always took the time to make sure we all understand thecourse material. she also went through many examples of the content during lecture, and at times, made her lecturesinteractive through online software called ""learning catalytics.""ballantyne - labs were always well run, never had any issues with any concepts or anything within the labs, alwaysrelated back to course material.wania - did not like his teaching style at all, not much learning going on. a whole bunch of examples without anyconcept work. concepts should be explained before providing examples on how to use them, not the other way around.thavarajah - just like first semester, great concept work and explanations, clear and concise. explains concepts verywell, easy to understand what is going on.the overall quality of instruction for this course was good because there was a sense of continuity between the twomodules and instructors that made the transition easier. they both had different teaching styles, however they both hadtheir advantages and disadvantages.the first part of the course is a little bit to understand well without practies. the prof did a good job in terms ofcalculations and different cases.it will be better if prof wania can explain more about the concepts.the instructions were very clear and easy to follow. the professors explained the material very well and any additionalinformation was available in the textbook.8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse.'","b""commentexcellentfsg's and office hours both of which were very helpfulchemaid centre was useful.the fsg's were very helpful in further understanding concepts in chemistry taught in this course.the fsg's were moderately helpful, as their worksheets helped when prepping for the midterm and finals.masteringchemistry assignments helped students keep on track and what material we needed to focus on. it gave abetter understanding of the material and content being learned.office hoursoffice hours were at good timesthe textbook, lecture notes. thavarajah: in-class peer instruction questions.there was a lot of assistance that was available to support my learning in the course. this included assistance fromthe instructors, the lab manager, the course tas, and from the facilitated study group coordinators. the assistanceavailable was very resourceful and helpful in answering the questions i had from the course material and the laboratoryactivities. the assistance could be improved by including more assistance, with possibly a seminar or extra informationprovided in the lab manual, on how to understand the concepts and apply the formulas for the laboratory activitieswhere the content was not previously covered in lectures.chemaid centre was a great help. need better access to ta's for lab stuff...usually we were left to wok out blue sheetswith stuff we were not familiar withoffice hours and fsg sessions were available to support in my learning.the profs were very open to questions and were also willing to help during office hours.the chemistry aid office is a fantastic resource.   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 7/13i didn't think there was much for help.my ta was always very open to answer any questions that i had regarding the course content and calculations i wasrequired to do.i think the textbook is very useful for me to practice and further understand course materials.tas at the chem aid center were helpful for some of the experiments.office hoursoffice hours and fsgsthe chem aid center was very very helpful throughout the semestermy ta was quite helpfuloffice hours are good.fsgs and office hours gave students the opportunity to ask questions about any concepts that may have been unclear.none usedthe fsgs were very helpful in practising course concept. it is suggested to implement the peer instruction activitiesthroughout the whole course.lectures tend to go fast sometimes and can be difficult to keep up with sometimes. suggestions for more practicequestions or being given practice questions would be nice.i think the chem aid centre was still open?prof office hours, and online assessments from mastering chemn/agoodnot surefsgs were quite helpfulthe fsg was helpfultas were nicethe fsg's are an amazing help.fsg's were very helpfulwhen frank was teaching the course i thought it was very helpful learning the course when he does example questionson the powerpoint. as for nirusha's teaching, it was very helpful as well because i thought her powerpoint notes werewell descriptive and detailed. plus she lets us do many example problems on learning catalytics and takes up theanswers together.during the portion frank wania taught, little assistance was available. during the portion nirusha thavarajah taught,she was very approachable and helped a great deal with understanding course material.n/aweboption lecturecastsassistance was available as office hours and the professor's email was also available.""","b ' excellentthe instructors were great , and had an obvious goal of improving student learning and understanding . i just found that it was a very slow paced course . the topics are things that were covered previously in high school andthe pace at which it was being ( re ) taught was painful . i just wished it was taught faster which would\ have made the experience more stimulating . in fact , chma11 and chma10 are complete reviews of gr12 materials and i feel that both courses could have beencombined into one and offered in the fall . we did not need to spend half a semester doing stoichiometry , gas laws , mfs , etc ; those could\ have been taught in a week . if both courses were combined then that gives us the freedom to undertake a second year chemistry course ( ex organicchem ) in the winter semester which would further (reduce) not course load in second year . i honestly didn\' t feel as if i needed to put any effort into these courses , partly because the instructors were amazing inexplaining concepts , but mostly because i spent a year in high school learning the same things . amazing professors and great slides and notes from both of them . it was hard to follow the instructing styles of the professors . both instructors were amazing at teaching the material . they were able to explain concepts well clearly . dr . wania and dr . thavarajah did an amazing job and giving clear and concise explanations for the content that neededto be covered . though dr . wania was a great professor , i always look forward to going to dr . thavarajah\' s lectures asshe is very engaging and really understands what students struggle with and can easily pinpoint the issues studentshave . yes i made a mistake , but also , i\ am a first year student who just came from highschool , i am allowed to make mistakes , you do not need to rub it in . the material being taught in the class was very well understood as the professor taught every lecture . quality of theinformation taught was clear and good for people to understand with students being able to use that knowledge in thefuture . good ! i had a hard time following professor wania during lecture . his writing was hard to understand and he would either govery slow or very fast on a topic . i did not enjoy going to class often . i liked how professor thavarajah gave usopportunities to work through the problems as a class . it helped me learn the information much faster . dr . wania\' s handwritten note - taking method was different and unique . dr . thavarajah was extremely helpful as sheprovided us with in - class opportunities to solidify learning . this included in - class sample questions . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good because the instruction was detailed and includedexamples to help me understand the course concepts . the instruction included sample problems which allowed me totest myself and to determine how much i understood the course concepts . the instruction could be improved byincluding more of these sample problems , particularly in the first half of the course . nirusha thavarajah has great teaching skills ; simplifying the problem matter in an easy understandable wayfrank wania\' s teaching skills were very helpful as xwell . taking up problem sets together and in a step - by - step processmade further studying easierlabs were the most stressful component of the course . in fact , myself and most of my acquaintances would argue that ittakes away from our learning time b/c of how demanding labs are ( pre lab/ post lab stuff , quizzes worth too xmuch , etc . ) very draining . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was good . the peer questions and other examples that were integrated in the lectures were very helpful in making me apply thisknowledge which led to a deeper understanding of the concept . the labs tend to be very rushed and stressful . this is not conducive to learning . longer lab sections with thesame experiments would actually be preferable . the lectures are somewhat unengaging although informative . there was a big difference in the way the two prof\' s taught . wania used markers and a overhead to get concepts whilenirusha with her powerpoints and quick pair and share . as soon as people got used to wania , the prof switched andthen it became harder for i , personally , to cope with the material . while i appreciate the professor wanting students to work through examples in class i feel xlike the class time spentwaiting for the class to finish the exercise could have been used for other things . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 3/31/2017 5/13a lot of examples were provided , which promotes the quality of the instruction because concrete applications are given . i enjoyed all the lectures and even labs this semester . both profs provided sufficient information for most assignments . for the first module with frank wania , i found it very difficult to keep up to the pace he was teaching . he didn\' t providevery neat and organized notes ( they were handwritten with sloppy writing ) and most of the time i had to re - watchlecturecasts to figure out what certain words meant . it was a horrible way of teaching for me personally . he basicallyjust told people what he was about to write , wrote it , and didn\' t discuss why or how he got to his answers . different ways of teaching were demonstrates . i feel xlike the labs could have been better timed with the content being learned in lecturedr thavarajah\' s teaching style was wonderful . i always understood what she was teaching . dr wania\' s method ofteaching was sometimes hard to follow . very informative lectures . however , the lab experience was terrible . i think that ta\' s should mark fairly for all practicalsand for all students . if two students submit the sheets , one ta would give 100\' s , while another would give 50\' s and 60\' sall for the same content . this drastically affects grades and creates an inequitable lab - grading system . either the ta\' sshould be more laid back when marking , or be nitty - gritty ; they should all be the same when marking . veryunsatisfactory grades from the lab component . on the positive note , the lectures are very informative and delivered verywell ! this course allows students to acknowledge the many different types of activities occurring on a daily basis . great profs . lectures were full of information and sample questions to improve understanding . labs were good withsome variety of experiments conducted . overall great course , learned a lot . i really enjoyed how dr . wania wrote the notes in class . it brought him down to the student level , and made it easy tofollow and not discourage us with a bunch of notes that were prepared before hand . i also enjoyed how he explainedthings thoroughly to begin , and then wrote down what he just explained . it gave me the opportunity to learn it twice . whati really enjoyed about dr . tharavajah\' s teaching style is the in class questions she posed us and then thoroughlywalked through the solution , making it clear what concepts were being applied , and how to answer questions related tothese topics . overall the instruction in this course was xwell above average . the use of peer instructions were really helpful for understanding the concepts of the course ( particularly during thesecond module ) . the labs were fun and interesting . i liked being able to work with my peers as xwell as on my own . lectures were goodand stimulating . students encouraged to participate during lectures . masteringchem is a great way of practice . labs are stressful . the clocks in the lab i was working in actually work this semester , which means we know the timenow , but rushing and messing stuff up to get the lab finished before the lab period is over is not helpful . the labs didhave to do with what we were learning in lecture , which is a lot better than last semester . for me at least , having thelabs use what we were learning in the lectures meant i actually knew what to do for the prelab . labs are still stressful . for the actual lectures . . . professor w . wrote his notes by hand during the lecture , which meant i could actually keep upwith what he was teaching us . for professor t\' s lectures i sometimes come out (without) not notes . i\ am next to uselessat the practice questions she has us do during the lecture because i\ am not wasting notebook paper on working themout . spending all lecture on practice questions is really helpful and a waste of time , if that makes any sense . helpfulbecause we\ are given an idea of the type of questions we might have to do , and a waste of time because we\ are notactually being taught anything . wania was a great prof but as the course progressed , the quality of his notes and lectures were decreasingsignificantly . nirusha was amazing as always , very clear and helpful with many though provoking questions that assista xgreat deal with understand even the most difficult conceptsdr . wania was very good at making complex concepts easier to understand with interesting examples and stimulatinglectures . goodit was good . clear , easy to understand and thoroughi personally struggle a xgreat deal with chemistry , so my response may not of good use . i think that the instructionwas well xdone , although fast , and if students give proper attention they can learn quite a lot in one year about chemistry . frank wania\' s section moved very slowly and it was quite hard to pay attention due to his methods . the overall quality was goodwas okay great ! good , love the way professor nirusha gives a lot of example questions during class which helps immensely with introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 3/31/2017 6/13understanding the concepts . professor nirusha\' s intruction methods were the most beneficial or easy to understandingwhen frank was teaching the course i thought it was very helpful learning the course when he does example questionson the powerpoint . it allows us the focus more in class and to fully understand the material as we write what he writes . as for nirusha\' s teaching , it was very helpful as xwell because i thought her powerpoint notes were well descriptive anddetailed . frank at times made it difficult to understand the content , providing us with examples that were difficult to understand . he also expected us to know certain material that most students , including myself , have (never) not learned in the past . henever took the time to explain it , and was not approachable . nirusha was excellent when it came to delivering content . she always took the time to make sure we all understand thecourse material . she also went through many examples of the content during lecture , and at times , made her lecturesinteractive through online software called "" learning catalytics . "" ballantyne - labs were always well run , (never) not issues with any concepts or anything within the labs , alwaysrelated back to course material . wania - did not like his teaching style at all , not learning going on . a whole bunch of examples (without) not work . concepts should be explained before providing examples on how to use them , not other way around . thavarajah - just like first semester , great concept work and explanations , clear and concise . explains concepts verywell , easy to understand what is going on . the overall quality of instruction for this course was good because there was a xsense of continuity between the twomodules and instructors that made the transition easier . they both had different teaching styles , however they both hadtheir advantages and disadvantages . the first part of the course is a xlittle bit to understand well (without) not practies . the prof did a good job in terms ofcalculations and different cases . it will be better if prof wania can explain more about the concepts . the instructions were very clear and easy to follow . the professors explained the material very well and any additionalinformation was available in the textbook . 8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse .

incorporating technology into the class, as well asdoing many examples in class realted to work.prof wana is really good and patient.professor wania\'s teaching style was very disorganized because he wrote down the notes during class as opposed tousing power point. because of this i found it difficult to distinguish between topics and organize my thoughts because iwas rushing to write down notes he was writing down very quickly. professor thavarajah was amazing, she explaintopics extremely clear and in a calm manner as she read through and explained the power point slides. i was able tofocus on the concept instead of rushing to write down the notes as i did with professor wania. the ta i had for pra 40was not helpful at all during the lab which was very unfortunate for my lab experience.very good keep recording lecdr. wania provided the best instruction in the course overall, i really appreciated his method of teaching. his methodmade me feel more alert as well as being able to actually go through the material with him instead of just being shownthe material. the only downside was that at some points his writing was hard to make out. furthermore i highly doubt iwould have enjoyed this method if weboption was not available because he went too fast. dr. tavarajah has a fairlygood approach as well however it is not as interactive or stimulating in my opinion. dr. ballantyne curated the labs wellhowever, i felt that i would have preferred my entire lab notebook be graded rather than a random lab. or if we had doneone professional lab report to be graded. lastly, i believe it was wholeheartedly unfair and exclusive for masteringchemistry to count for 5% of our grade. the reality is many students buy their textbook second hand or simply rent itfrom the library. however the mastering chemistry is not available second hand or from the library it is a resource thestudents are forced to purchase and that is unacceptable. you should keep it as an option but also provide a secondarygrading scheme for those who chose not to buy it. it is not inclusive because it is not a resource openly available to all,it is avilable to those who pay for it and i should not have to pay to get 5%.thorough, methodical, easy to follow and informative. i appreciate that out of all of my classes this is the one where theprofs are best at using worked examples to help make the material more understandable and accessible to students.my only recommendation would be to make the teaching styles a bit more engaging - i like it when pictures and videosare used, as they are generally also very helpful - as i had difficulties staying awake in class at times and it had nothingto do with any lack of interest in the material. monotonous lectures are hard to listen to.excellentthroughout my experience in chma11 (and even 10) i\'ve never said there a bad chem prof. in fact, i think theseprofessors have inspired me to continue in chemistry to learn more as their teaching was interesting, and taught at apace i could follow.the course is not really good. the lab is gross some time. and the ta is not really helpful.very goodboth professor\'s teaching styles were very different but it was easy to understandprofessor wania explained concepts very well but there was a lack of practice questions.professor nirusha integrated application questions in the lectures which helped in the understanding of coursematerials.the labs were not enjoyable, had a heavy workload and took too much time. the lab quizzes required information fromexternal resources that were not always provided (ex: periodic table). it was not a good experience for the most part.the presentation technique used by dr. wania was abnormal from my experience as a student and i did not feel like itwas an affective technique towards my understanding of the material.i really like professor n. tharavajah ! she\'s so nice and helpful!i really enjoyed this course, and practice questions were helpful to test comprehension of the materiali really enjoyed the peer-instructions given by professor thavarajah.dr.wania was great, i really appreciate that he made thorough notes and proceeded at a really good pace. i also enjoyed dr.nirusha\'s peer instructions, all the practice questions done in class were very helpful!i really cannot say enough good things about both dr. wania and dr. thavarajah. very different lecturers, but bothwonderful. thavarajah especially is so kind and personable, and really takes an active interest in your comprehensionof the material.    introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 5/13i also cannot say enough good things about my lab ta, aime kayembe. in stark contrast to last semester, he made mefeel comfortable and reasonably confident in the lab, and was easy to approach with questions (and actually answeredthem), and helped find equipment and glassware when necessary. i appreciated his organization with checkingcleanliness of glassware and cleanliness of the bench. he is very professional, clearly very knowledgeable, but at thesame time manages to be personable and easygoing so as not to whip up anxiety, making the lab feel safer and moreproductive overall.dr. thavarajah has a very friendly and approachable personality. she is excellent at explaining the course material anda very inspiring and motivating professor, always patiently and kindly answering all questions and going over morechallenging concepts at a great pace. her in-class peer-instruction questions are very helpful to understand and learnthe concepts.the content was somewhat interesting. the material was a bit difficult. the course load was very heavy and so thatmade for a negative experience.second half of the course was great, first half it was terrible.i would recommend professor wania to put a bit more enthusiasm in his course. sometimes, it is useful to go beyondthe textbook and its content reiteration and add a bit of \'something"" that would differ lectures from reading the textbook.still, overall the course was well-planed and instructors were helpful.instruction was somewhat straightforward. however, i feel that concepts should be conveyed in more simple terms (maybe not during lecture, but for sure in postlecture notes).frank wania was a very boring prof and his teaching style did not work for me at all,l. i hated how he didn\'t hav anyslides but thought is by making messy hand written notes. most of the time i would focus on figuring out what he haswritten instead of paying attention to what he\'s doing, as well, he would jump from one topic to the next and then back tothe same topic which confused my ass and made it difficult to understand the concepts. he also talked in a way that hewould start off with medium pitched voice and then during the end of the sentence he would mumble his words underhis breath. even when using weboption and turning the volume up, ut was hard to catch those last few words.very goodfrank wania taught mainly through examples, which was manageable; however, some more concrete instructionwould have been helpful. it was not always clear what exactly he wanted us to know. nirusha thavarajah was an amazing instructor. she teaches the concrete theorems and rules, and then usesexamples to expand on those and to help students understand. in class, it\'s always clear what she expects us to learnand where she is going. in terms of the labs, they were not always very co-ordinated with the subject material; however, they were generallyhelpful and provided some insight and experience doing what we were learning about in class. i found the quizzes,especially towards the beginning of the course, were much more difficult than they needed to be.very goodthe overall quality of the instruction in this course was great , however there are some very important points that i like topoint out. firstly, both of the professors frank wania and nirusha thavarajah were so helpful and so clear whileexplaining in class lectures. secondly , the quizzes of the lab as i heard from my colleagues and my experience differfrom each other of the level of thinking and of being hard or easy and this is not fair for some group of students. somelab quizzes are easier than others ad enable these students who had these easy quizzes to score much more higher inthe lab component percentage than the other students who always had hard quizzes , again this is not fair. as well asta s differ a great deal from each other , if a ta is pursuing their masters or phd or is just an undergraduate student ,they differ and this again affects the practicals who have phd pursuing ta s and these ta s always expect more fromthe students and search for little small derails that other ta s won\'t even search for and this again in not fair for certaingroup of students.the different professors and lab coordinator had such different teaching styles that it was hard for me to adjust to theirteaching. the overall quality was fair.professors wania and thavarajah are unapproachable and if approached provide no assistance with the concepts theywere teaching. the midterm and the final is made to fail students and get a low class average. professor waniaprovides a learning atmosphere during lecture by asking students questions regarding the topic being taught in classwhich i found to be intellectually stimulating. professor thavarajah does not provide a learning experience duringlecture but rather reads off her lecture slides and does not explain concepts when asked content based questions. ta\'sin laboratory sessions are very rude and do not help students when faced with a question but leaves the student tofigure things out on their own. marking schemes in the lab are very strict and ta\'s don\'t provide the reasoning behindtheir marking.it was engaging and i was able to stay invested during lectures.all of them are the amazing people in utsc.   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 6/13very fast paced class requiring lots of practice and attention. sometimes difficult to keep up with.amazimgthe instructions was okay. the labs related well to the subject matter. i found that frank wania should give studentstime to work through his examples themselves and then share the answers, just to confirm their learning.throughout the course i was able to understand a few concepts and a few that i had to learn on my own because iwasn\'t able to grasp on the way it was being taught.the lectures were structured very well, the assignments were very good and overall quality of the course is good!profs were always prepared and taught the course material in a clear manner.very well explained, at a reasonable pacegoodthe overall instructions in this course were very clear, and easy to followgoodfairly interactive however, i felt professor wania used majority of the lecture hour hand-writing the slides rather thanfocusing topics that we\'re considered challenging.instruction was very clear and concise. the instructions were very well worded that there was no questions about theinstructions.overall, dr. thavaraga, dr. wania, and dr. ballentyne, provided an exceptional quality of instruction in the course. ienjoyed, the pace at which dr. thavaraga spoke in, during lecture.8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse.'","b""commentfsg's, lab ta's, as well as the professors were all eager to help the students!the ta of this course is kind and helpful to my lab.i wish there was more assistance especially regarding questions about lab reports, it would be helpful if there wassomeone to go to clarify questions about the lab material.somewhat goodthe mock exams were very helpful to my learning.lots, but my first go-to resource (fsgs) were at inconvenient times (in the middle of afternoons that i desperatelyneeded for getting other homework done), and often overcrowded when i went. if i might make a suggestion, i think itwould be cool if we could get not-for-marks exam-practice masteringchemistry assignments. mc was a highlyinformative source for me, both in the step-by-step way that it presented homework questions and the feedback it gavefor both right and wrong answers. if we got practice questions on it, i would certainly make use of them.readily available.wasn't very pleased with the ta i had. in psychology, it was explained that ta's all go through practice sessions in orderfor their marking scheme to be the same. with chem on the other hand, i felt like what grade you received in the labreflects the type of ta you got. ta wasn't approachable, didn't seem like she knew what she was doing, and the markingdidn't seem fair (didn't really point out errors, just took marks off). didn't want to get on her bad side consistently askingher where i got marks off; didn't get much support from ta.nothingvery goodprof wania was not very approachable while prof thavarajah wasthe fsg sessions had a great deal of practice questions which were really helpful.fsg's and friends.office hours, fsgpeer-instructions were very helpful.fsg's really helped me get through the material and do well!i did not particularly make use of additional aid.the facilitated study groups were extremely helpful to practice the course concepts, the facilitators were great at   introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-3/31/2017 7/13leading the sessions, they clearly understand the material very well and their questions were very helpful guiding thestudents to come up with the solutions them-selves.the chem-aid centre was also a great help with answering all course and lab related questions.fsg's were available and a bit helpful.email and office hours with dr.thavarajahchem aid centre was helpful.chemaidchem aid center was a big help. thanks for providing me with this resource.nathe chem aid centre is pretty helpful , and they can help you with course materials and lab report sheets. as well asthe mock midterm and final that both professors posted on blackboard were pretty helpful.fsg sessions and office hoursnonethere was a lot of assistance available but i personally did not seen it out.mastering chem is actually great for confirming if we actually know what we're doing.the lecture slidesfsgsthe assistance available to support my learning were great since they held office hours to helpgoodmastering chemistry during the first half of course was challenging and didn't help clarify the main points discussed inprof. wania's lectures.visiting the professor's office hours were always recommended and encouraged. fsg's was also a helpful resource topractice my knowledge.while attending dr.thavaraga's and dr. ballentyne's office hours, i felt comfortable asking questions, and my questionswhere answered in a clear, polite, and nice manner, which improved my overall understanding for the concept. i likedhow when dr. ballentyne is asked a question regarding the lab, he asks the students questions about the coursecontent, which hints the students towards the right direction, and allows them to understand the lab, and coursematerial better.""","b ' the quality of the instruction was great ! using peer - instruction and incorporating technology into the class , as xwell asdoing many examples in class realted to work . prof wana is really good and patient . professor wania\' s teaching style was very disorganized because he wrote down the notes during class as opposed tousing power point . because of this i found it difficult to distinguish between topics and organize my thoughts because iwas rushing to write down notes he was writing down very quickly . professor thavarajah was amazing , she explaintopics extremely clear and in a calm manner as she read through and explained the power point slides . i was able tofocus on the concept instead of rushing to write down the notes as i did with professor wania . the ta i had for pra 40was not helpful at all during the lab which was very unfortunate for my lab experience . very good keep recording lecdr . wania provided the best instruction in the course overall , i really appreciated his method of teaching . his methodmade me feel more alert as xwell as being able to actually go through the material with him instead of just being shownthe material . the only downside was that at some points his writing was hard to make out . furthermore i highly doubt iwould have enjoyed this method if weboption was not available because he went too xfast . dr . tavarajah has a fairlygood approach as xwell however it is not interactive or stimulating in my opinion . dr . ballantyne curated the labs wellhowever , i felt that i would have preferred my entire lab notebook be graded rather than a random lab . or if we had doneone professional lab report to be graded . lastly , i believe it was wholeheartedly unfair and exclusive for masteringchemistry to count for 5% of our grade . the reality is many students buy their textbook second hand or simply rent itfrom the library . however the mastering chemistry is not available second hand or from the library it is a resource thestudents are forced to purchase and that is unacceptable . you should keep it as an option but also provide a secondarygrading scheme for those who chose not buy it . it is not inclusive because it is not resource openly available to all , t is avilable to those who pay for it and i should not pay to get 5% . thorough , methodical , easy to follow and informative . i appreciate that out of all of my classes this is the one where theprofs are best at using worked examples to help make the material more understandable and accessible to students . my only recommendation would be to make the teaching styles a bit more engaging - i like it when pictures and videosare used , as they are generally also very helpful - as i had difficulties staying awake in class at times and it had nothingto do with any lack xof xinterest in the material . monotonous lectures are hard to listen to . excellentthroughout my experience in chma11 ( and even 10 ) i\ have (never) not said there a bad chem prof . in fact , i think theseprofessors have inspired me to continue in chemistry to learn more as their teaching was interesting , and taught at apace i could follow . the course is not good . the lab is gross some time . and the ta is not helpful . very goodboth professor\' s teaching styles were very different but it was easy to understandprofessor wania explained concepts very well but there was a lack xof xpractice questions . professor nirusha integrated application questions in the lectures which helped in the understanding of coursematerials . the labs were not enjoyable , had a heavy workload and took too xmuch time . the lab quizzes required information fromexternal resources that were not provided ( ex : periodic table ) . it was not good experience for the most part . the presentation technique used by dr . wania was abnormal from my experience as a student and i did not like itwas an affective technique towards my understanding of the material . i really like professor n . tharavajah ! she\' s so nice and helpful ! i really enjoyed this course , and practice questions were helpful to test comprehension of the materiali really enjoyed the peer - instructions given by professor thavarajah . dr . wania was great , i really appreciate that he made thorough notes and proceeded at a really good pace . i also enjoyed dr . nirusha\' s peer instructions , all the practice questions done in class were very helpful ! i really can not say enough good things about both dr . wania and dr . thavarajah . very different lecturers , but bothwonderful . thavarajah especially is so kind and personable , and really takes an active interest in your comprehensionof the material . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec02 - nirusha thavarajah - 3/31/2017 5/13i also can not say enough good things about my lab ta , aime kayembe . in stark contrast to last semester , he made mefeel comfortable and reasonably confident in the lab , and was easy to approach with questions ( and actually answeredthem ) , and helped find equipment and glassware when necessary . i appreciated his organization with checkingcleanliness of glassware and cleanliness of the bench . he is very professional , clearly very knowledgeable , but at thesame time manages to be personable and easygoing so as not whip up anxiety , making the lab feel safer and moreproductive overall . dr . thavarajah has a very friendly and approachable personality . she is excellent at explaining the course material anda very inspiring and motivating professor , always patiently and kindly answering all questions and going over morechallenging concepts at a great pace . her in - class peer - instruction questions are very helpful to understand and learnthe concepts . the content was somewhat interesting . the material was a bit difficult . the course load was very heavy and so thatmade for a negative experience . second half of the course was great , first half it was terrible . i would recommend professor wania to put a bit more enthusiasm in his course . sometimes , it is useful to go beyondthe textbook and its content reiteration and add a bit of \' something "" that would differ lectures from reading the textbook . still , overall the course was well xplaned and instructors were helpful . instruction was somewhat straightforward . however , i feel that concepts should be conveyed in more simple terms ( maybe not during lecture , but for sure in postlecture notes ) . frank wania was a very boring prof and his teaching style did not work for me at all , . i hated how he didn\' t hav anyslides but thought is by making

available!fsg \xe2\x80\x93 helped further understand the few things that weren't clear in lectures. professor came around the lecture hall toindividuals to ensure that they understood any in\xe2\x80\x93class examples and in case any students had questions.i found that the pre\xe2\x80\x93midterm review was very helpful for understanding the material as well as becoming familiar withthe format of the actual midterm.office hours by prof were extremely helpfulassistance was always made available to students through peer instructions, review sessions and fsgsquick to respond to emails, sufficient office hours!! great!!i believe her lectures note and mastering questions were the best learning supportmasteringchemistry helped alot with filling in the gaps that i did not understandi went to the weekly fsgs which greatly improved my confidence on the course materials. it also helped to meet otherstudents that are as eager to do well in the course at the fsgs.the tas and students were helpfuloffice hours helped a lotthe office hours and fsgs for this course were both very helpful and helped me achieve a good grade on my final examoffice hours were a great help as well as the fsg sessions.n/aoffice hours and fsg sessions were available for this course.assistance was plentiful.the pearson online help tools such as the mastering chemistry, online textbook, and assignments provided extrasupport in helping me understand the content that was being taught throughout the coursefsgs, office hours, prep sessions before an exam.the professor's office hours were helpful.easy to reach the professor, office hours made sense for the class timesmidterm review sessions, learning catalytics, mastering chemistry, concept map etc.coming into class being able to discuss my answer was crucialim still gonna failoffice hours, and she replied to emails very quickly. also, peer instruction helped a great deal.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-y-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-8/7/20186/16

regioselectivity for products as they have some logic following them. i do wish the material for reagents ofdifferent reactions after being taught could be presented as an empty chart for that lecture, so we could divide thematerial into associated reactions for oxidation, adding a carbonyl etc. during peer instructions for some lectures. thepeer instructions and problem sets were helpful.the peer instruction sections were useful because on top of essentially being a homework segment in class (whichencouraged people to work on problems), talking about the problems with others created a better understanding of thecourse material.good!!little material in the beginning, but great peer instructionsi hope i could take more courses with the instructor and i hope the instructor could introduce her research to usthe professor explains concepts very clearly and the lecture notes provided are excellent for studying. i also really likedthe peer instructions that we did in class. my only suggestion would be to have the peer instructions set up so thatthere's one every hour or so (or one hour of lecture, one hour of peer instructions, and then another hour of lectures) sothat we can identify areas we are struggling with before moving onthe instruction given by the lecturer and lab coordinator was very well. the lab skill seminars were very helpful and thetas were all helpful. the lectures were helpful and the peer instructions as well. the lectures were given very well andhelped me understand the material. thank you to both of the professors for their hard work!the professor was very interactive with the leaning process which it made it very enjoyable.dr. nirusha was great. she provided good help to students during office hours and in class. she also provided a great learning atmosphere inclass. topics covered were also interesting to me. dr. lana was also great. always available to help students with the lab component and beyond.narusha did a great job explaining concepts and giving students an opportunity to practice the material she taught. thein class problems were extremely helpful to reinforce the learning done in class and i would highly recommendkeeping them in for the following years.lana is a fantastic lab coordinator and did a great job making sure students were able to carry out reactionssuccessfully, and explain why they didn't if something went wrong. she was a great help to all the students and gavethem all an opportunity to succeed.decent instruction.dr nirusha has a very depth understanding of the material and is

course was very stimulating intellectually as each concept introduced in the lectures was supplemented by practice questionson a regular basis. this encouraged student to understand the concepts as they were being taught in the lecture and contributed tosolve misconceptions they might have had. in my opinion this was the most positive aspect of the course and the most importantpart of what made it so good overall.very well done, ensured students understood the material.i like the peer instruction in the lecture. it gives us an opportunity to practice right after learning a new concept, and the instructorexplains how to approach the question clearly.not bad but not greatlab ta was inconsistent in marking and was not helpful in learning (practical 4). she was condescending, dismissive, and rudewhen answering questions during labs. ie: pressured us to leave early, judged us if we took longer than other students, yelledconstantly.otherwise, i loved dr t's teaching style and she is very inspiringi throughly enjoyed the course and had me thinking about how the lessons taught in class can be applied in the real worldthe way the course material was taught was in a really good manner. each topic was fully covered and explained before moving onto the next one. overall the teaching in this summer chemistry course was excellent.goodthere were a lot of questions in the lectures to make sure you understand what your learning, which i liked.nirusha has made this extensive hard course easy to follow through her very unique style of teaching. overall, the quality of thecourse was awesome! nirusha has definitely made me go from hating chemistry to liking it a lot!mastering chem announcements were not made, unclear deadlines and midterm should be provided a equation sheet.before taking chma11 with dr. nirusha, i just wanted to complete the required chem courses for my program and never take chemagain. i can now confidently say that dr. nirusha made me love chemistry and inspired me to continue taking upper level chemcourses. the quality of instruction is beyond excellent.she made the course easier to understandthe professor was very good at explaining the concepts and was always engaging the classroom with activities, i would gladly takethis course again.amazing. loved all the different strategies used to convey/teach material (sample problems,

lot of learning assistance available to assist us in the course. we had the chem help center, professor office hours andfacilitated group study sessions. i attend the professor's office hours several times and the group study sessions once. i found bothto be very helpful. the office hours in particular were pretty lengthy and almost always at the same place (and the professor told us ifthat was no the case,making them easy to reach.in addition to this, we were provided with many recommendations for the textbook questions, as well as practice booklets for theexams. these helped me me work during the semester and prepare for my exams.there were fsgs and office hours that were useful.office hours, fsg, ta for pract 4 was not helpful at all!i was able to access the professor (via office hours)

for this course was also very helpful.chm aid centreoffice hours were available to support my learning of the course. however, i wished that there was a chem aid center during thesummer semester, during the winter semester the chem aid center was very beneficial.there was much assistance available during the course. fsgs were offered weekly for students as well as the chemistry helpcentre. also, the professor held office hours during the week too. this meant help was available when needed.the chem aid centre helps provide chem related solving skills which helps consolidate

teacher than professor sullan. professor thavarajah followed the syllabus schedule\xcd\xbe being abusy student with multiple science courses, i find it very helpful to know what chapters to prepare for in advance. professor sullandid not follow the syllabus chapter schedule, switching weeks 10, 11, & 12. i had a very time\xe2\x80\x93consuming art project during this time,and had already previewed the expected syllabus chapter 13\xcd\xbe however, the switch to chapter 18 cost me time and affected boyperformance in both the mastering chemistry online quiz as well as the art project itself. additionally, professor thavarajah\'s slidesprovided specific quantitative and qualitative practice questions with ample time for us to practice skills taught mid\xe2\x80\x93lecture, and wasprovided strong reinforcement in my knowledge. on the contrary, professor sullan provided very few quantitative questions, and forthe few qualitiative questions, provided an average of approximately 5 seconds for students to work out a response before movingonto provide us with a cryptic answer solution \xe2\x80\x93 definitely not enough time. she then blames our incapability to answer herquestions instantly because he haven\'t ""studied hard enough"", when the purpose of lecture is to reinforce previewed material.fortunately, i was able to find reinforcement through the textbook chapter questions, and have been relying on it solely since the endof professor thavarajah\'s lectures.very informed and instructors were passionate about their subjects and strived for the success of their students.i left this course without much understanding in chemistry. lectures were not interesting, they were very dull.interesting, because the professor starts a new topic with daily natural observances and then explains it with concepts of the topics.also the in class questions and answers round is great.dr. nirusha explained very very well.instruction of the course was able to cover all listed content but was done in a manner that was often faster than i can write, whichencourages review of the lecture/textbook material prior and/or after the lectures. learningcatalytics questions highly encouragelecture attendance due to participation and performance in these questions being of value towards our final mark in the course. inthe latter half of the course, the instructor highly relied on making the lectures very attention\xe2\x80\x93grabbing with the use of interesting andrelatable topics to the overall topic of the lecture and using analogies/comparisons to help us visualize the concepts she teaches.good quality and contentinstruction was decent but syllabus should not require a student to pass either the midterm or final. passing the lab componentand overall in the course should be sufficient.nirusha was an excellent professor, her review questions were very helpful.prof. thavarajah is a really engaging professor, but she sometimes skims through major points just to finish the lecture.prof. sullan is enthusiastic at what she\'s doing, but sometimes fails to explain concepts that are hard to understand.concepts couldve been explained better or not be as rushed through materialsgood.moderateprofessor thavarajah was an excellent professor, explained content very well, midterm exam was fair.professor sullan was hard to understand, lectures were too fast\xe2\x80\x93paced.the first half of this course was much more conducive to learning than the second half, largely due to the professor.interactive learning during lectures attained through practice questions presented by instructorsboth professor ruby and professor nirusha are caring excellent at explaining concepts and professional. however, one of the labtechs, vladimir zaplishny, was overly critical and didn\'t have the same professionalism as the professors.professor tharavajah explained concepts well and the peer questions were helpful mostly while studying, giving an insight of whatquestion to expect in the midterm. she also provided textbook questions for further practice, this was helpful because some ofthese questions were slightly complex, helpful to self\xe2\x80\x93asses. professor sullan also explained the topics well and connected them to real life situations making it easier to approach the topic.however, here mastering chemistry question do not provide steps. i personally feel like the steps/hints are very helpful to calculatethe questions by ourselves and process the info given. if i get a question wrong or have no idea how to do it, at least i have thesteps to guide me through the calculations. also, having the hints encourages the students to at least do the questions bythemselves instead of asking others.it was clear, but also really boring.i felt the first part of the semester professors were highly effective in their teachings. they provided an immense amount supportand tools for their students that allowed for excellent learning. their lectures were very insightful, concise and direct. specifically,professor thavarajah was amazing because she provided multiple areas of practice, i felt highly prepared for the midterm due toher through teaching. her lecture slides were also very clear and representative of the textbook. however, professor sullan was notas effective due to a lack of understanding in her lectures. she teaches at an extremely fast pace that prevents a thoroughunderstanding of the material. she also did not provide the same amount of preparation of practice which leads to having to relyheavily on the textbook and greater learning independently.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/5/2019 4/16commentsit was good. i wish the prof for the second half of the course would explain the practice questions in more detail like the first prof did.i loved the way both nirusha and ruby provided us with practice problems to work on throughout the lectures to ensure weunderstood the content.boring lectures with ruby.too many questions during class, would rather have shorter classes and simply learn the content.it was good. i loved nirusha\xe2\x80\x99s teaching style. however, i felt my chem ta was not goodthe lab portions are much more challenging but aid in learning. nirusha is fair regarding exams however her teaching style is a bitboring. ruby\'s teaching style is also not very engaging.overall this course felt difficult in the second half due to the change in professor. i felt like the overall quality of lectures and outsideclass help dropped. in the first half, we had sample questions posted up and practice midterms to aid our learning of the contentbut it felt like all that help disappeared in the second half. i feel like i would have enjoyed the course a lot more if the teachingchange was not made.topics from each chapter were explained clearly and enough examples were done to clarify any issues. instructors provided helpand resolved any course issues fromgood, hard. ballantyne was very rude. not approachable at all.honestly, i don\'t understand what my profs are saying. it\'s so frustrating trying to understand their accents and moderately brokenenglish. i just had to essentially teach myself the course.the course contents were well interlinked and offered a knowledge structure. i was also able to connect the concepts with what ilearned in physics. during my lab experiences i was able to improve my analytical ability through understanding the reason for eachstep of the procedure and comparing the actual value with the theoretical value.professor thavarajah\'s peer instruction problems were really conductive to my learning, and had helped me recognize gaps in myknowledge during class. professor thavarajah had explained concepts clearly and slowly. the quality of her slides were excellentand well detailed. professor sullan was overall satisfactory. she does go slightly quickly through some concepts, and doesn\'t allowenough time for us to process the problems. it is important to realize that it\'s not just about the number of problems that we solve inclass, but more importantly our thorough understanding of the concepts presented in each problem. the slides of professor sullanwere not very detailed, and the logical order of the concepts should have been clearly presented. however, i have really enjoyedlooking at the applications of what i was learning in professor sullan\'s modules.professor nirusha was a great teacher inside and out of class, doing many examples and working through each step of theproblems to ensure that every single student understood what they were learning. alternatively, professor ruby was helpful but onlywhen visiting her office hours. she did not go as in depth as needed when explaining the practice questions, usually leaving mewith the same questions after class, resulting in me needing to visit her office hours for clarification on questions that should havebeen explained during class.but the labs. firstly, in the lab manual there are many references to the \'appendix\' that explains techniques used in some labs. thisappendix does not exist. this means that, when going into the lab, the ta assumed we had already knew how to do some thingsthat we didn\'t. secondly, the pre lab talk was supposed to help us get a practical sense of what we were supposed to do, however,my ta was quite bad at explaining things, resulting in most students needing clarification from him multiple times later on in the lab.finally, the lab manual itself was helpful in some cases but other times it seemed as though it was being intentionally confusing.for example, when it came to doing the pre lab for lab 5, there are multiple pages including the \'explanation\' for the rate lawmethod. said \'explanation\' is the most confusing thing i\'ve ever read since shakespeare. two and a half pages that do not evenproperly explain in a comprehensive way the meanings of all the terms. it took five hours for me to fill my notebook with what ithought was what i was supposed to do.i understood what i learnedi think because chemistry is such a calculation\xe2\x80\x93based course, i didn\'t find the use of slides very useful. i liked the addition of anumber of sample questions in the slides especially in nirusha\'s module because she had solutions and explained them morethoroughly. ruby\'s also had solutions but sometimes they missed steps that were important for my personal understanding.goodboth instructors were good at explaining course material. for dr. ruby sullan, it would help tremendously if she posts slides beforeclasses. i don\'t have much to say, but only a few words in regard to dr. scott ballentyne. even though i only had one interaction withhim, he is not really approachable. however, i\'m sure he\'s a good dude. he just needs to open up a little more.introductory chemistry ii

this time , nd had already previewed the expected syllabus chapter 13\xcd\xbe however , the switch to chapter 18 cost me time and affected boyperformance in both the mastering chemistry online quiz as xwell as the art project itself . additionally , professor thavarajah\' s slidesprovided specific quantitative and qualitative practice questions with ample time for us to practice skills taught mid\xe2\x80\x93lecture , and wasprovided strong reinforcement in my knowledge . on the contrary , professor sullan provided very few quantitative questions , and forthe few qualitiative questions , provided an average of approximately 5 seconds for students to work out a response before movingonto provide us with a cryptic answer solution \xe2\x80\x93 definitely not enough time . she then blames our incapability to answer herquestions instantly because he haven\' t "" studied hard enough "" , when the purpose of lecture is to reinforce previewed material . fortunately , i was able to find reinforcement through the textbook chapter questions , and have been relying on it solely since the endof professor thavarajah\' s lectures . very informed and instructors were passionate about their subjects and strived for the success of their students . i left this course (without) not understanding in chemistry . lectures were not interesting , they were very dull . interesting , because the professor starts a new topic with daily natural observances and then explains it with concepts of the topics . also the in class questions and answers round is great . dr . nirusha explained very very well . instruction of the course was able to cover all listed content but was done in a manner that was often faster than i can write , whichencourages review of the lecture/textbook material prior and/or after the lectures . learningcatalytics questions highly encouragelecture attendance due to participation and performance in these questions being of value towards our final mark in the course . inthe latter half of the course , the instructor highly relied on making the lectures very attention\xe2\x80\x93grabbing with the use of interesting andrelatable topics to the overall topic of the lecture and using analogies/comparisons to help us visualize the concepts she teaches . good quality and contentinstruction was decent but syllabus should not require a student to pass either the midterm or final . passing the lab componentand overall in the course should be sufficient . nirusha was an excellent professor , her review questions were very helpful . prof . thavarajah is a really engaging professor , but she sometimes skims through major points just to finish the lecture . prof . sullan is enthusiastic at what she\' s doing , but sometimes fail to xexplain concepts that are hard to understand . concepts couldve been explained xbetter or not rushed through materialsgood . moderateprofessor thavarajah was an excellent professor , explained content very xwell midterm exam was fair . professor sullan was hard to understand , lectures were too xfast\xe2\x80\x93paced . the first half of this course was much more conducive to learning than the second half , largely due to the professor . interactive learning during lectures attained through practice questions presented by instructorsboth professor ruby and professor nirusha are caring excellent at explaining concepts and professional . however , one of the labtechs , vladimir zaplishny , was overly critical and didn\' t have the same professionalism as the professors . professor tharavajah explained concepts well and the peer questions were helpful mostly while studying , giving an insight of whatquestion to expect in the midterm . she also provided textbook questions for further practice , this was helpful because some ofthese questions were slightly complex , helpful to self\xe2\x80\x93asses . professor sullan also explained the topics well and connected them to real life situations making it easier to approach the topic . however , here mastering chemistry question do not provide steps . i personally feel xlike the steps/hints are very helpful to calculatethe questions by ourselves and process the info given . if i get a question wrong or have (no) not idea how to do it , at least i have thesteps to guide me through the calculations . also , having the hints encourages the students to at least do the questions bythemselves instead of asking others . it was clear , but also really boring . i felt the first part of the semester professors were highly effective in their teachings . they provided an immense amount supportand tools for their students that allowed for excellent learning . their lectures were very insightful , concise and direct . specifically , rofessor thavarajah was amazing because she provided multiple areas of practice , i felt highly prepared for the midterm due toher through teaching . her lecture slides were also very clear and representative of the textbook . however , professor sullan was notas effective due to a lack xof xunderstanding in her lectures . she teaches at an extremely fast pace that prevents a thoroughunderstanding of the material . she also did not provide the same amount of preparation of practice which leads to having to relyheavily on the textbook and greater learning independently . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/5/2019 4/16commentsit was good . i wish the prof for the second half of the course would explain the practice questions in more detail like the first prof did . i loved the way both nirusha and ruby provided us with practice problems to work on throughout the lectures to ensure weunderstood the content . boring lectures with ruby . too xmany questions during class , would rather have shorter classes and simply learn the content . it was good . i loved nirusha\xe2\x80\x99s teaching style . however , i felt my chem ta was not goodthe lab portions are much more challenging but aid in learning . nirusha is fair regarding exams however her teaching style is a bitboring . ruby\' s teaching style is also not engaging . overall this course felt difficult in the second half due to the change in professor . i felt xlike the overall quality of lectures and outsideclass help dropped . in the first half , we had sample questions posted up and practice midterms to aid our learning of the contentbut it felt xlike all that help disappeared in the second half . i feel xlike i would have enjoyed the course a lot more if the teachingchange was not made . topics from each chapter were explained clearly and enough examples were done to clarify any issues . instructors provided helpand resolved any course issues fromgood , hard . ballantyne was very rude . not approachable at all . honestly , i don\' t understand what my profs are saying . it\' s so frustrating trying to understand their accents and moderately brokenenglish . i just had to essentially teach myself the course . the course contents were well interlinked and offered a knowledge structure . i was also able to connect the concepts with what ilearned in physics . during my lab experiences i was able to improve my analytical ability through understanding the reason for eachstep of the procedure and comparing the actual value with the theoretical value . professor thavarajah\' s peer instruction problems were really conductive to my learning , and had helped me recognize gaps in myknowledge during class . professor thavarajah had explained concepts clearly and slowly . the quality of her slides were excellentand well detailed . professor sullan was overall satisfactory . she does go slightly quickly through some concepts , and doesn\' t allowenough time for us to process the problems . it is important to realize that it\' s not about the number of problems that we solve inclass , but more importantly our thorough understanding of the concepts presented in each problem . the slides of professor sullanwere not detailed , and the logical order of the concepts should have been clearly presented . however , i have really enjoyedlooking at the applications of what i was learning in professor sullan\' s modules . professor nirusha was a great teacher inside and out of class , doing many examples and working through each step of theproblems to ensure that every single student understood what they were learning . alternatively , professor ruby was helpful but onlywhen visiting her office hours . she did not depth as needed when explaining the practice questions , usually leaving mewith the same questions after class , resulting in me needing to visit her office hours for clarification on questions that should havebeen explained during class . but the labs . firstly , in the lab manual there are many references to the \' appendix\' that explains techniques used in some labs . thisappendix does not exist . this means that , when going into the lab , the ta assumed we had already knew how to do some thingsthat we didn\' t . secondly , the pre lab talk was supposed to help us get a practical xsense of what we were supposed to do , however , y ta was quite bad at explaining things , resulting in most students needing clarification from him multiple times later on in the lab . finally , the lab manual itself was helpful in some cases but other times it seemed as though it was being intentionally confusing . for example , when it came to doing the pre lab for lab 5 , there are multiple pages including the \' explanation\' for the rate lawmethod . said \' explanation\' is the most confusing thing i\ have ever read since shakespeare . two and a half pages that do not evenproperly explain in a comprehensive way the meanings of all the terms . it took five hours for me to fill my notebook with what ithought was what i was supposed to do . i understood what i learnedi think because chemistry is such a calculation\xe2\x80\x93based course , i didn\' t find the use of slides very useful . i liked the addition of anumber of sample questions in the slides especially in nirusha\' s module because she had solutions and explained them morethoroughly . ruby\' s also had solutions but sometimes they missed steps that were important for my personal understanding . goodboth instructors were good at explaining course material . for dr . ruby sullan , it would help tremendously if she posts slides beforeclasses . i don\' t have much to say , but only a few words in regard to dr . scott ballentyne . even though i only had one interaction withhim , he is not approachable . however , i\ am sure he\' s a good dude . he just needs to open up a xlittle more . introductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah -

outsidehelp concept instruction fully explain lecture lab messy since bb collaborate allow student clas around student enroll","b'the quality of instruction was good and understandablegoodthere are lots of details and examples in the lecture. the course is motivating.the information discussed was often covered in extensive detail. however, this was true mostly for content from high school. newconcepts were often overlooked or ""glossed over,"" with little explanation leading to a lower understanding of the purpose of thoseconcepts and how to apply those concepts. the first half of the course and part of the second were synchronous. that meant someof the class had to watch the course after the time slot because there was not enough room on bb collaborate. over time, fewerpeople came out to these sessions. when it became asynchronous, classes were inconsistent in length and often would have tobe done in multiple sittings because some lectures went almost half an hour over time. this was discouraging and made attentivelearning difficult. on the other hand, the course was a great review from high school and gave me a greater understanding of thoseconcepts. it was hard to listen to a disembodied voice, but i was able to take extensive notes. the homework was predictable intiming and in nature, making it neither overly difficult nor stressful. unfortunately, i did not feel inspired by this course. i really wantedto be, but instead i developed a dread that perhaps chemistry was not as interesting as i previously thought. i recognize that we arein a pandemic, but a little enthusiasm from the professors would go a long way. for these reasons, i believe the course was good,but it may be improved.first half of the course felt rushed, however the second half felt like the material was well taughti liked the structure of all lectures taught by both professors. i would have preferred additional support for understanding the labquestions/concepts being taught.goodoverall, the quality of instruction was very good and i\'ve learned a lot from the lectures and lab sessions.the course was not as nicely structured as bioa01. students were divided into odd and even practical, and the odd practicalstudents had to complete their lab before they actually learned the content in the lecture. it gave an unfair advantage to the evenpractical students. the lectures by professor marco was engaging and interesting with a really difficult midterm. professor xiao\'slectures were fair but dry at times.it is hard to find the important points to review on the test.professor marco was straight to the point i liked his teaching style. due to some technical difficulty professor zhang had to makehis classes asynchronous. his slide were good however they overlapped with a lot of the topics taught in professor marco\'s lectureso it wasn\'t very engaging.unfair lab quizzes. grade dropped from 100 to 60 because i rounded differently throughout the question and ended up being acouple decimal places off.overall, i think the quality of instruction was good. however, i think some concepts could have been elaborated more on, rather thanjust being a summary of the textbook.both halves of the course are being well taught. the professors go well into depth about the concepts being taught.the delivery of the course was good, anything that i couldn\'t grasp in class was when the textbook greatly helped.the instruction in this course was well done especially with the transition to online learning. i would have hoped that some parts ofthis course take into consideration that the students are living through a global pandemic and learning online at home. i wouldhope that the workload would not be as heavy when living through this global pandemic by possibly combing work or findingdifferent ways of assessment for students.the overall instruction of this course was well. however, my main concerns are with the lab component of this class. it was poorlyorganized and stressful and made me hate course in general. the lab manager was cordial at times, yet she was inconsistent withher instructions and email correspondence. the instructions and quizzes were never clear and contained plenty of mistakes, thatrequired the student to consequently email her, only yo get a response weeks later. this interrupts my learning experience and ismy only negative feedback for this course. during the pandemic, my mental health deteriorated and this course labs componentadded on to that. i spent too much time on this component and was always stressed because her questions were never relevant.the course was for the most part well structured. prof zimmer was super helpful and created a comfortable environment to learn.his synchronous sessions with the posted slides were interactive and also gave me a chance to make good friends in this toughonline environment. as with every course, there are technical difficulties which is expected with online learning but i did notappreciate prof zhang deleting the lectures (after just 2 weeks). i rather would have appreciated if the lectures were kept for a monthfor review. i was particularly frustrated to see the lectures deleted and had to rely on fsg\'s for learning. the labs were wellstructured and online labs progressed smoother than expected. here\'s hoping we can set foot to an actual lab next term.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was excellent. i thought the lectures were very excellent quality because theyhelped to address the main concepts from the textbook. the mastering chemistry helped me to practice the concepts learned inlecture.more examples would be helpful. additionally, it was very frustrating that the students in the even practicals oftentimes receivedintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/7/2020 4/24commentscourse material well before their due dates as compared to the odd practicals that had less time with the lecture material that wouldgreatly improve the understanding needed to complete lab reports for marks.the course instructors did a good job in delivering the course material. i just didn\'t like that halfway through the course we had tomove our classes to asynchronous due to audio quality. besides that, i think the material was well delivered and explained.the professors did a good job teaching the content in the course. my only recommendation would be to conduct more examples inthe lectures to accurately match questions given as mastering chemistry assignments.nirusha was nice but she wasn\'t helpful when it came to the lab quizzes. when i know i was right i was still not given full marks sheeven once told me that i did something really well that i hadn\'t even\xe2\x80\x93handed in. the quizzes weren\'t fair and should be changed. ieven once told nirusha that i had time accommodations and that if i could get them for my lab quizzes she said i have 20 mins and2 attempts and nothing else. which is what everyone got. professor marco was amazing. he taught really well and made itinteresting.both of my lecture instructors explained the topics very clearly and included some practice questions into their lectures which ifound very useful. but with the practicals, i found the instructions very vague and unnecessarily complicated and difficult. in myopinion the lectures were of high quality whereas the practicals were not.i thought that the professors and tas were able to explain very difficult concepts and ideas to me very clearly, for the most part. i dofeel that the pace of the course was quite fast compared to other courses.the quality was good and i think the instruction was pretty straight forwardthe professors were nice and taught the material somewhat well. when changed from synchronous to asynchronous it effected mylearning negatively. also making it so lectures get deleted after a week of them being posted is ridiculous. also, making tests andexams so that students can not look back at the answers is the worst thing ever! from lectures being deleted and tests not lettingyou check your answers i feel like i\xe2\x80\x99m being punished for having to do school online. the labs are also terrible, watching a youtubevideo then having to hand write my lab manual (include procedures and tables) is not fair to students. if i\xe2\x80\x99m not participating in alab hand on i shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hand write a full manual every time. i hope the chem ii is run better.i feel the course content could have been explained better. the professors just rushed through the content with minor explanationsof certain topics such as calculationsthe pace of the lectures is good. there is a good balance between the information taught and time for thinking.the instruction was great, but i felt that my hard work on this course did not reflect well on the midterm \xe2\x80\x93 and there\'s only one \xe2\x80\x93because since this is the first year we are doing online learning, and its the first semester of first year for most students taking thiscourse, the course could have been more understanding and made accommodations until students get better suited to universityand online learning.i really liked the lectures as they were informative and teachers spent a good amount of time explaining the content.all professors are knowledgeable of the course and presented the concepts clearly. however, i wish that all lectures could havebeen live because i feel that i gained more knowledge during live lectures than the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded ones.n/athe overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good, as i was able to understand all the material presented easily, andfelt comfortable enough to ask questions when i needed to. despite the restrictions on interaction due to the pandemic, i felt that thelectures, whether they were synchronous or asynchronous, were very successful at trying to create an in\xe2\x80\x93person atmosphere.all of the instructions on the quercus are well organized and neatly presented.there is a lot of assignments that go with this course, including lab material. mastering chemistry allows us to practice problemswhich allows better understanding. there were times when labs were assigned before the related material was taught, resulting inus having to teach ourselves. lab assignments should also be explained a little more thoroughly, so the presentation of labnotebooks is done so in an ideal way. there should also be a way that students can study for post lab quizzes so they know what toexpect instead of it being a surprise. the tutorials were very helpful.the first professor went a little too fast at the beginning. he would skip math problems as we did not have enough time left, butthese are the concepts that many students struggle with. the professor did explain the concepts very well. the first half of thecourse could be better if the professor took time explaining the different type sof math questions provided in the lecture. he alsomade use of questions to get students to interact, i found this very helpful! the second professor was not including engagement, soi was always demotivated. the lectures were hard to follow along as the teaching style was not great.the overall instruction in this course was easy to understandthe audio of this course is not the best. and i find prof marco\'s lecture to not be as engaging.the course was good, instructors were kind and answered questionsi much rather like in\xe2\x80\x93class lectures. in honest options, some lecture sounds are horrible and i lost interest in learning. thus, i knowdelateing lectures videos are keeping engaging yet we all lost a ""second chance"" to fully understand some complex ideas.the instruction was quite thorough. there was simply a lot of heavy content that had to be covered, making this course moreintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/7/2020 5/24commentsdifficult, but the instruction was still quite thorough.it was a good course overall, but i wish there was more support for labs during the first month and more examples of questions thatmay be in the exam in lectures.the professors taught this course well, but i often found it very boring. i usually like chemistry and maybe it\'s because i\'ve lost allmotivation for school, but i did not find it fun and interesting to learn about this time around.i like how in depth we went into certain topics, and the explanation of the importance of certain topics would be in future chemistrycourses.i absolutely loved this course! definitely one of my favourites. in high school, i didn\'t really enjoy chemistry that much due to the waythat high school courses are structured but i still found the content intriguing. in this course, in particular, the lab structure (eventhough it was all online) was not only quite fun to complete but actually helped me understand the content in a real work application.in terms of lectures, i found prof. marco\'s lectures very clear and easy to follow. the only improvement that i would say is that prof.marco went a little fast sometimes, but i was able to get around it by watching the recorded lectures wherever i thought i needed to.prof zhang\'s lectures were also clear (aside from the technical problems we were encountering in the beginning) and at times,pretty easy to understand.technical issues for both lecturers impacted instruction somewhat. there was a limit to the amount of students allowed to enter thecourse room (500 limit for an 1000 student class) which greatly impacted the first few lectures \xe2\x80\x93 this should have been worked outbefore the year started. mic problems for both lecturers impacted understanding \xe2\x80\x93 for the second half of the semester, lecturesbegan to be uploaded asynchronously instead of having live lectures as a result. asynchronous lectures naturally limit interactionwith the instructor, though this was partially remediated by having a simultaneously run bb\xe2\x80\x93collaborate room open at the time thelectures would have been held to ask questions. slides used in the lectures were uploaded before classes, concepts wereexplained fairly well.explanation for the expectations for labs were unclear at the beginning as well.the professor explained concepts clearly in lecture and offered practice questions for students to better grasp the concept.professor hosted office hours twice per week which was helpful.a bit heavy and way too fast\xe2\x80\x93paced at times, but otherwise it was good.the course was organized and taught well.the course material was fair, some professors would talk too fast and sometimes they would not really explain what was on theslides. i feel we should of provided more hdespite the challenging situation we are in today, i appreciated all the professors\' hard work for making this course a fantasticlearning experience. even if the course was provided online, it did not hinder the quality of education i received from the professors.i loved professor marco\'s lectures they were nice and it always felt like i was constantly engaged. in the second half we had to moveto async so it was tough especially since the concepts were more challenging it was harder to understand.the quality of this course was excellent, the concepts were clearly taught by professors. they were very understanding and verygood at explaining hard topics in a more understanding way.the first part of the course (prof. m zimmer de\xe2\x80\x93iuliis) was very well taught and conductive to learning. the second part (prof. xiao\xe2\x80\x93an zhang) has been well\xe2\x80\x93taught within the lectures. however, they do not leave the lecture recordings up for more than a weekwhich is stressful because i have to make sure i download them (per agreement) before they are taken down and am constantlyworrying that i missed something because i can\xe2\x80\x99t count on being able to go back and double check the list of lectures like i can withall my other professors.the midterm felt like a poor representation of our knowledge being demonstratedgreatboth instructors were passionate about what they were teaching and tried their best to deliver the content online. however, therecorded lectures were sometimes very choppy and it was hard to hear what was being discussed at times, which made thelearning process difficult. the instruction in this course was great, but the delivery could use some improvement.decentinstructors were only, reading slides and it was so boring. also they were not able to describe it clearly.the course was fine, but with the switching of profs, it was difficult to keep up with what they wanted to see and what questionswould be on quizzes and assignments. the workload was also a lot which was difficult to balance with my other classes, that hadthe same workload. the lab quizzes don\'t exactly show the intellectual level of the class, since it is being marked automatically bythe computer. these marks definitely did not help the overall class average, adding onto the workload which was hard to keep upwith, causing the class and i to not be able to do the best we can do.it was finei personally believe that the beginning of the course was great, i loved the live sessions, where the class was engaging and theprofessor was asking a lot of questions. however i do have to say that i do not really like asynchronous, as there was some drawintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-12/7/2020 6/24commentsback in the way that you can\'t ask questions.the teaching was okay and i mostly taught myself through the textbook. :(good course. it would be nice if the exam had the option to go back to previous questions as this relieves the stress of the time limitand allows students to think over questions they may be stuck on.besides some technical difficulties that i can totally understand, it was greatthe lectures were extremely engaging and interesting.this course is so hard to manage and a simple error can drag the entire mark down. our professors are good but the amount ofworkloads and the way the questions and time limit for exams are formatted is so hard to keep up with.this course was easy to understand as the professors explained all the concepts very clearly.the overall quality of the instruction in this course is good.they were helpful in answering any questions.all of the instruction given was clear and any questions i had were answered.the instructors taught the course very well. i hope that the first half of the course can be

understand the class material.i was aware of office hours and the professors have emails on the syllabus if we the students needed to reach out to them. therewere also first year learning groups. there were discussion boards that were supposed to be monitored regularly, but i noticed anumber of questions went unanswered.email, tutorials, office hours, and fsg sessions were helpful.exam should

the post\xe2\x80\x93lab calculations. the and the fsgs were adapted well to fit the needs ofthe students. i like how the lab instructor had her own office hour and updated the notebook module with the feedback of thestudents.office hours and the fsgs were very helpful.the fsg\'s and tutorial sessions were very helpful.i appreciate the office hours, the tutorials and also the tas.the tutorials session by aisha were very helpful and helped me understand new concepts.there was a helpful ta, aisha javed who did tutorials and was the only reason i did okay on the lab component.prof, ta and other faculty members did their very best to respond and clarify any questions which i appreciate tremendously.the fsg\'s were particularly helpful since lectures were deleted. the practice questions in the tutorial were also of great assistance.the professors provided excellent support for learning in this course, by promptly responding to emails and addressing anyconcerns, as well as clarifying concepts.i didn\'t find the first few lab practicals helpful because it was mostly the ta reading off the slides and not really explaining the lab.i would recommend that for labs, an instructional video that covers post lab questions be prepared and uploaded for every lab inthe course to give students a better understanding of what to do as we are learning remotely.i had accommodation allowing me more time.there were office hours.i really liked the assistance, especially from the ta\'s. i think that they were very helpful.never sought supportfsg\xe2\x80\x99s were availablelinh viet is the best ta!good.office hours, emails, tutorials were all very useful! great!i think that there could have been more assistance with the lab quizzes, as they were very difficult. though there were postlabquestion for practice, without the answers, we won\'t have a clue if we\'re doing it correctly or not. and the methods needed to solvethe questions are new to us, so i think the postlab practise questions should be more helpful so we can actually pass the labcomponent.my ta was very passionate and explained the labs well. she answered questions very thoroughly and encouraged participation.n/aalthough i have only interacted with one of the two professors, professor marco, i can surely say that asking for assistance orclarification on some matter through email was very easy to do, and extremely helpful.i really appreciate the fsg sessions. attending sarah nanquil\'s sessions were very helpful. she is very patient, and she makessure that everyone understands the concepts before moving on. i know she will make a great teacher in the future. i hope shefacilitates more study groups.all of the instructors are really helpful, in answering our emails and providing answers during office hours. there are tutorials tohelp our understanding of the course materials which is very helpful.office hours were available and professors answered to emails!having ta\'s is already a

were regularly available. course staff were typically quite responsive to emails.the tutorials were very helpful for me when solving labwork.fsgs were available, but i did not get to attend any due to my workload. i often find myself trying to complete assignments andquizzes more than actually learning the material because of the heavy courseload. i would suggest giving a smaller courseworkload so that students can actually attend fsgs and other supplementary supports to help understand the material.lab tutorials, discussion boards, flr session, office hours, email, coffee sessions.along with each prof\'s office hours, there were also chemists consuming coffee, practicals, and fsg sessions. the ""discussion""board was also really useful to clarify any misunderstandings.discussion section on quercus was open though it appears questions weren\'t answered very often there. weekly lab tutorials werevery helpful to further explain concepts introduced in the labs.office hours were open

discussions on quercus, were available to support my learning in the course.mastering chemistry, chemists consuming coffee sessions, fsgs, professorsassistance was available as needed.fsginstructors should focus on how to explain the topic from the core. if instructors are about to read the slides, it is better to not teach.instead give notes to the students and take exams.the fsg group, office hours, emailing.email and discussion boards were availablefor assistance i would email the professors or ta\'s, or i would be in contact with a friend which is taking the same course in orderto better explain me a certain concept in the case that i do not understand it.there were tutorials that were held that helped so much! the tutorials are were where i learned most of my lab skills!talking to the professor directlyfsg session and assignment in the textbookit was okay but i still find it hard to understandfsg and office hours were very helpful when taking this course.n/an/amy ta did a good job of responding to any questions i had.the lab sessions are great. there is a connection between the content of the labs and our course materials. they interact to helpme gain a deeper understanding.the fsg were helpfulthe best support was the tutorials that helped with lab calculations. getting straight forward or detailed help from tas is like talkingto a wall and discussing anything with peers is looked down upon because online learning and \'cheating\'. the tutorials did helpexplain concepts in a straight forward way. the fsgs may have been more helpful if the schedule was not constantly changingbecause unfortunately students do have other things and classes to attend.it was kind of hard to pay attention online so i just studied by myself.office hour sessions where availableoffice hours, ta presentationsthe time to prepare for labs should be extended. i hope they increase the chance to prepare and work on lab quizzes much moreeasily for future students. i don\'t think it\'s fair to simply have 3 questions for calculations and only giving them full marks when theygot the perfectly accurate answer, students should get marks for working and effort too. the resources for preparation for labcalculations could be better as well.fsg sessions were good support for students along with tutorials which helped to practice with the lab questions.we could email either of the instructors or ask a question during office hours if we had trouble with a concept.responds to email fastthe tutorials were very helpful for labs.introductory chemistry i

as the synchronous lab sessions with my ta. shoutout to monica because she was a wonderful andvery helpful ta.the textbook and masteringchemistry was a great help.practical were great, patricia, our

and office hours were useful.the uploaded past papers and other course material were helpful, as were the revealed answers to the midterm. practicalexperiments seem not to be directly related to course material but would have helped develop wet lab skills.\xe2\x80\x93 extensive office hours by second instructortutorials were more helpful than online lab practicals themselves, since these were

were replied quickly.we need live lessons!we had live lecture course rooms, weekly fsgs, tutorial sessions, as well as coffee interaction sessions.homeworks are well designed to deepen my understanding of the course content.email was availablethe practicals were good. my ta did a great job explaining the labs and some other course content to us. however, i do wish thatthere was maybe more time given to explain what specifics were required from the notebook submissions. a lot of the errors that ipersonally made in terms of file type and submission style could have easily been avoided if the content was elaborated on in moredepth.emails are answered quickly and the professors are very understanding overall great support. office hours were great too. i neverattended the fsg\'s.\xe2\x80\x93 masteringchemofficer hours, fsgsthere were tutorials, office hours, lecture hours (later in the term)and discussion boards. in fact, there was such abundance of helpi think it could have been delivered more efficiently.the mastering chem homework helped to close the gaps and allowed me to practice the skills taught in the lectures. the tashelped me understand the lab but the related calculations were confusing.office hours for each professor was available for me.the professors provided office hours and would respond to emails to answer any remaining questions.the fsgs were really helpful and i found it fun to engage in them. i didn\'t feel forced or obligated to go, but i found that they reallyhelped.i didn\'t reach out at all, but i\'m sure that would\'ve helped.a large majority of my encoding came through the chma fsg\'s and i honestly owe a lot of my success this semester to thosesessions because i was having trouble learning from lecture.have emailed the instructions a few times for clarificationsnone since it is difficult to communicate online for me.i really think mastering chemistry helped me with concepts and calculations. it gave you experience and walked you throughquestions you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to answer, which was excellent.the first lab seems to intimidate students\xcd\xbe it was difficult, and i find little relevance from it. after that the lab became doable.the homework are difficult to track because there are no reminders on quercus, which is a huge disappointment.it\'s also not nice that they delete the lectures after

helpful in the tutorial sessions, providing us withclear problem solving methods for our labs!office hoursi think my ta, zhibo wang, was very good. he was funny, outgoing, open, and explained the concepts to the group\'s satisfaction. iwas able to understand the concepts well through the practical sessions with this ta and the advice he gave was good as well. ialso like the mastering chemistry assignments as they help me practice and understand concepts even further.there wasn\'t any assistance that really supported my learningtutorials, fsg, office hours, email, practical sessions, tas,

the questions were worded on the midterm threw me off greatly.i found the weekly lecture summaries a very good method for active recall. they are also proving to be a good technique for examreview.the assistance was great as the tas and fsg opportunities were very helpful'","b ' the quality of instruction was good and understandablegoodthere are lots of details and examples in the lecture . the course is motivating . the information discussed was often covered in extensive detail . however , this was true mostly for content from high school . newconcepts were often overlooked or "" glossed over , with (little) not explanation leading to a lower understanding of the purpose of thoseconcepts and how to apply those concepts . the first half of the course and part of the second were synchronous . that meant someof the class had to watch the course after the time slot because there was not enough room on bb collaborate . over time , fewerpeople came out to these sessions . when it became asynchronous , classes were inconsistent in length and often would have tobe done in multiple sittings because some lectures went almost half an hour over time . this was discouraging and made attentivelearning difficult . on the other hand , the course was a great review from high school and gave me a greater understanding of thoseconcepts . it was hard to listen to a disembodied voice , but i was able to take extensive notes . the homework was predictable intiming and in nature , making it (neither) not overly difficult (nor) not stressful . unfortunately , i did not inspired by this course . i really wantedto be , but instead i developed a dread that perhaps chemistry was not interesting as i previously thought . i recognize that we arein a pandemic , but a xlittle enthusiasm from the professors would go a long way . for these reasons , i believe the course was good , ut it may be improved . first half of the course felt rushed , however the second half felt xlike the material was well taughti liked the structure of all lectures taught by both professors . i would have preferred additional support for understanding the labquestions/concepts being taught . goodoverall , the quality of instruction was very good and i\ have learned a lot from the lectures and lab sessions . the course was not nicely structured as bioa01 . students were divided into odd and even practical , and the odd practicalstudents had to complete their lab before they actually learned the content in the lecture . it gave an unfair advantage to the evenpractical students . the lectures by professor marco was engaging and interesting with a really difficult midterm . professor xiao\' slectures were fair but dry at times . it is hard to find the important points to review on the test . professor marco was straight to the point i liked his teaching style . due to some technical difficulty professor zhang had to makehis classes asynchronous . his slide were good however they overlapped with a lot of the topics taught in professor marco\' s lectureso it wasn\' t very engaging . unfair lab quizzes . grade dropped from 100 to 60 because i rounded differently throughout the question and ended up being acouple decimal places off . overall , i think the quality of instruction was good . however , i think some concepts could have been elaborated more on , rather thanjust being a summary of the textbook . both halves of the course are being well taught . the professors go xwell into depth about the concepts being taught . the delivery of the course was good , anything that i couldn\' t grasp in class was when the textbook greatly helped . the instruction in this course was well done especially with the transition to online learning . i would have hoped that some parts ofthis course take into consideration that the students are living through a global pandemic and learning online at home . i wouldhope that the workload would not heavy when living through this global pandemic by possibly combing work or findingdifferent ways of assessment for students . the overall instruction of this course was well . however , my main concerns are with the lab component of this class . it was poorlyorganized and stressful and made me hate course in general . the lab manager was cordial at times , yet she was inconsistent withher instructions and email correspondence . the instructions and quizzes were (never) not clear and contained plenty of mistakes , thatrequired the student to consequently email her , only yo get a response weeks later . this interrupts my learning experience and ismy only negative feedback for this course . during the pandemic , my mental health deteriorated and this course labs componentadded on to that . i spent too xmuch time on this component and was always stressed because her questions were (never) not relevant . the course was for the most part well structured . prof zimmer was super helpful and created a comfortable environment to learn . his synchronous sessions with the posted slides were interactive and also gave me a chance to make good friends in this toughonline environment . as with every course , there are technical difficulties which is expected with online learning but i did notappreciate prof zhang deleting the lectures ( after just 2 weeks ) . i rather would have appreciated if the lectures were kept for a monthfor review . i was particularly frustrated to see the lectures deleted and had to rely on fsg\' s for learning . the labs were wellstructured and online labs progressed smoother than expected . here\' s hoping we can set foot to an actual lab next term . the overall quality of the instruction in this course was excellent . i thought the lectures were very excellent quality because theyhelped to address the main concepts from the textbook . the mastering chemistry helped me to practice the concepts learned inlecture . more examples would be helpful . additionally , it was very frustrating that the students in the even practicals oftentimes receivedintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/7/2020 4/24commentscourse material xwell before their due dates as compared to the odd practicals that had (less) not time with the lecture material that wouldgreatly improve the understanding needed to complete lab reports for marks . the course instructors did a good job in delivering the course material . i just didn\' t like that halfway through the course we had tomove our classes to asynchronous due to audio quality . besides that , i think the material was well delivered and explained . the professors did a good job teaching the content in the course . my only recommendation would be to conduct more examples inthe lectures to accurately match questions given as mastering chemistry assignments . nirusha was nice but she wasn\' t helpful when it came to the lab quizzes . when i know i was right i was still not full marks sheeven once told me that i did something really well that i hadn\' t even\xe2\x80\x93handed in . the quizzes weren\' t fair and should be changed . ieven once told nirusha that i had time accommodations and that if i could get them for my lab quizzes she said i have 20 mins and2 attempts and (nothing) not . which is what everyone got . professor marco was amazing . he taught really well and made itinteresting . both of my lecture instructors explained the topics very clearly and included some practice questions into their lectures which ifound very useful . but with the practicals , i found the instructions very vague and unnecessarily complicated and difficult . in myopinion the lectures were of high quality whereas the practicals were not . i thought that the professors and tas were able to explain very difficult concepts and ideas to me very clearly , for the most part . i dofeel that the pace of the course was quite fast compared to other courses . the quality was good and i think the instruction was pretty straight forwardthe professors were nice and taught the material somewhat well . when changed from synchronous to asynchronous it effected mylearning negatively . also making it so lectures get deleted after a week of them being posted is ridiculous . also , making tests andexams so that students can not back at the answers is the worst thing ever ! from lectures being deleted and tests not lettingyou check your answers i feel xlike i\xe2\x80\x99m being punished for having to do school online . the labs are also terrible , watching a youtubevideo then having to hand write my lab manual ( include procedures and tables ) is not fair to students . if i\xe2\x80\x99m not participating in alab hand on i shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hand write a full manual every time . i hope the chem ii is run better . i feel the course content could have been explained better . the professors just rushed through the content with minor explanationsof certain topics such as calculationsthe pace of the lectures is good . there is a good balance between the information taught and time for thinking . the instruction was great , but i felt that my hard work on this course did not well on the midterm \xe2\x80\x93 and there\' s only one \xe2\x80\x93because since this is the first year we are doing online learning , and its the first semester of first year for most students taking thiscourse , the course could have been more understanding and made accommodations until students get better suited to universityand online learning . i really liked the lectures as they were informative and teachers spent a good amount of time explaining the content . all professors are knowledgeable of the course and presented the concepts clearly . however , i wish that all lectures could havebeen live because i feel that i gained more knowledge during live lectures than the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded ones . n/athe overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good , as i was able to understand all the material presented easily , andfelt comfortable enough to ask questions when i needed to . despite the restrictions on interaction due to the pandemic , i felt that thelectures , whether they were synchronous or asynchronous , were very successful at trying to create an in\xe2\x80\x93person atmosphere . all of the instructions on the quercus are well organized and neatly presented . there is a lot of assignments that go with this course , including lab material . mastering chemistry allows us to practice problemswhich allows better understanding . there were times when labs were assigned before the related material was taught , resulting inus having to teach ourselves . lab assignments should also be explained a xlittle more thoroughly , so the presentation of labnotebooks is done so in an ideal way . there should also be a way that students can study for post lab quizzes so they know what toexpect instead of it being a surprise . the tutorials were very helpful . the first professor went a xlittle too xfast at the beginning . he would skip math problems as we did not time left , butthese are the concepts that many students struggle with . the professor did explain the concepts very well . the first half of thecourse could be better if the professor took time explaining the different type sof math questions provided in the lecture . he alsomade use of questions to get students to interact , i found this very helpful ! the second professor was not including engagement , soi was always demotivated . the lectures were hard to follow along as the teaching style was not great . the overall instruction in this course was easy to understandthe audio of this course is not best . and i find prof marco\' s lecture to not engaging . the course was good , instructors were kind and answered questionsi much rather like in\xe2\x80\x93class lectures . in honest options , some lecture sounds are horrible and i lost interest in learning . thus , i knowdelateing lectures videos are keeping engaging yet we all lose a x"" second chance "" to fully understand some complex ideas . the instruction was quite thorough . there was simply a lot of heavy content that had to be covered , making this course moreintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 12/7/2020 5/24commentsdifficult , but the instruction was still quite thorough . it was a good course overall , but i wish there was more support for labs during the first month and more examples of questions thatmay be in the exam in lectures . the professors taught this course xwell but i often found it very boring . i usually like chemistry and maybe it\' s because i\ have lost allmotivation for school , but i did not find it fun and interesting to learn about this time around . i like how in depth we went into certain topics , and the explanation of the importance of certain topics would be in future chemistrycourses . i absolutely loved this course ! definitely one of my favourites . in high school , i didn\' t really enjoy chemistry that much due to the waythat high school courses are structured but i still found the content intriguing . in this course , in particular , the lab structure ( eventhough it was all online ) was not only quite fun to complete but actually helped me understand the content in a real work application . in terms of lectures , i found prof . marco\' s lectures very clear and easy to follow . the only improvement that i would say is that prof . marco went a xlittle fast sometimes , but i was able to get around it by watching the recorded lectures wherever i thought i needed to . prof zhang\' s lectures were also clear ( aside from the technical problems we were encountering in the beginning ) and at times , retty easy to understand . technical issues for both lecturers impacted instruction somewhat . there was a limit to the amount of students allowed to enter thecourse room ( 500 limit for an 1000 student class ) which greatly impacted the first few lectures \xe2\x80\x93 this should have been worked outbefore the year started . mic problems for both lecturers impacted understanding \xe2\x80\x93 for the second half of the semester , lecturesbegan to be uploaded asynchronously instead of having live lectures as a result . asynchronous lectures naturally limit interactionwith the instructor , though this was partially remediated by having a simultaneously run bb\xe2\x80\x93collaborate room open at the time thelectures would have been held to ask questions . slides used in the lectures were uploaded before classes , concepts wereexplained fairly well . explanation for the expectations for labs were unclear at the beginning as xwell . the professor explained concepts clearly in lecture and offered practice questions for students to better grasp the concept . professor hosted office hours twice per week which was helpful . a bit heavy and way too xfast\xe2\x80\x93paced at times , but otherwise it was good . the course was organized and taught well . the course material was fair , some professors would talk too xfast and sometimes they would not explain what was on theslides . i feel we should of provided more hdespite the challenging situation we are in today , i appreciated all the professors\' hard work for making this course a fantasticlearning experience . even if the course was provided online , it did not hinder the quality of education i received from the professors . i loved professor marco\' s lectures they were nice and it always felt xlike i was constantly engaged . in the second half we had to moveto async so it was tough especially since the concepts were more challenging it was harder to understand . the quality of this course was excellent , the concepts were clearly taught by professors . they were very understanding and verygood at explaining hard topics in a more understanding way . the first part of the course ( prof . m zimmer de\xe2\x80\x93iuliis ) was very well taught and conductive to learning . the second part ( prof . xiao\xe2\x80\x93an zhang ) has been well\xe2\x80\x93taught within the lectures . however , they do not leave the lecture recordings up for more than a weekwhich is stressful because i have to make sure i download them ( per agreement ) before they are taken down and am constantlyworrying that i missed something because i can\xe2\x80\x99t count on being able to go back and double check the list of lectures like i can withall my other professors . the midterm felt xlike a poor representation of our knowledge being demonstratedgreatboth instructors were passionate about what they were teaching and tried their best to deliver the content online . however , therecorded lectures were sometimes very choppy and it was hard to hear what was being discussed at times , which made thelearning process difficult . the instruction in this course was great , but the delivery could use some improvement . decentinstructors were only , reading slides and it was so boring . also they were not able to xdescribe it clearly . the course was fine , but with the switching of profs , it was difficult to keep up with what they wanted to see and what questionswould be on quizzes and assignments . the workload was also a lot which was difficult to balance with my other classes , that hadthe same workload . the lab quizzes don\' t exactly show the intellectual level of the class , since it is being marked automatically bythe computer . these marks definitely did not help the overall class average , adding onto the workload which was hard to keep upwith , causing the class and i to not able to xdo the best we can do . it was finei personally believe that the beginning of the course was great , i loved the live sessions , where the class was engaging and theprofessor was asking a lot of questions . however i do have to

lectures was very frustrating . communication was insufficient . consistently need to seek outsidehelp because concepts and instructions were not explained in lecture/labs . it was very messy since bb

15comments8 please comment assistance available support learn course comments","b'professor sullan was great as she provided practice problems frequently and went over topics to reiterate what she had just taught.her teaching was very clear. professor vozny was not clear at all, sometimes it looked like he was unsure of the material he waspresenting and it was not clear at all.the course instructor\'s were excellent, especially the first half professor voznyy. managed to take a subject i found abhorrent in highschool and make it enjoyable. also appreciated how he focused on the applications of the content and relating them to real lifesituations. also the nilered/blue videos were great.second half was amazing with a prof that ensured comprehension was suffice. ruby made chemistry an extremely enjoyableexperienceinstruction was usually clear.first half of the course was quiet confusing for me. i found it easier to read the textbook rather than studying from lectures slidesbecause it didn\'t help much. he could should have done more examples and questions in class to better prepare for the exam.also, i don\'t think video shown in class was necessary as it didn\'t help reinforce any concept learnt. however, the masteringassignements were useful because the questions were well constructed and helped me better understand. for the seoncd half of the course, i loved how she did a review of each concept learnt on the previous lecture before starting a newone. this was useful as it didn\'t make me forget stuff that i learnt weeks ago. also, she would always make questions relating to thelecture that appeared on previous exams. so far, i find that the way she teaches in great and readings from the textbook wasnecessary only if a concept was not understood properly.prof.sullan was very engaging and thoroughly explained concepts, she taught and then demonstrated with examples. sheanswered questions really well and is a kind person. this instruction was very helpful to my learning. we didn\'t have instructornirusha, no comment in her/his teaching. prof. voznyy was timely in his slack responses, but did not engage the class inconversation as much as i would\'ve liked, nice guy though.i like the way prof ruby taught. she was very clear and slowed down when necessary. prof vonzyy was not clear and it seemed likehe didnt understand some concepts himself so he would rush over those. his exam did not have a fair amount of all content that welearned during his time teaching.professor voznyy was not a very good professor. he seems uninterested in what he teaches, and his slides were copy and pastedstraight from the textbook. in class examples were nothing like the midterm questionsi hope university decides that even though researchers are genius some of them cannot teach that\xe2\x80\x99s why future researchers end upgiving up something that they want,which this case was chemistry for me!the instruction of this course was fair. the professors of this courses did a good job explaining hard questions during class.however, the labs for this semesters were sometimes lacking instructions, so maybe consider revising the lab manual multipletimes so it is clear for the student on what is to occur during the lab.alex vozny should not be teaching this course. dr. sullan explained all her concepts very well with examples. dr. vozny did not goover any examples in class, he only covered concepts which are no help for the exams or online assignments. he should do more""showing"" in terms of examples and less ""telling"". we learn if you show us something especially if its a brand new concept that wehave not learned before. dr vozny\'s classes were only 30 minutes each when they are actually supposed to be 50 minutes inlength. he could have used those extra 20 minutes every day to go over examples like dr. sullan did. dr. alex vozny should not beteaching this course at all. he automatically ""assumes"" most of us know what he is talking about but that is rarely the case. hetalked about buffers and titrations as if we were experts in those. again, very disorganized. he didn\'t even use his clicker properly.for the people on weboption, we couldn\'t even see what he was pointing to on the slides. and majority of the time he spent in classwas going back and forth to different slides. his midterm was really wierd too. it was out of 30 with 20 multiple choice questions butapparently the final mark was out of 20. not only that but the passing mark was 5? how does that work?the overall quality of learning was good in terms of learning and retaining the course material. however, the professors canimprove on their dedication to teach students. the marking scheme of the midterm was unfair and confusing, but the questionswere fair.goodthe overall quality of the instruction in this course was good. although the professors provided thorough lectures presenting classmaterial, i believe that more time provided to examples (going through examples) would help student better\xe2\x80\x93understand concepts.its decent, not too bad, but not of 100% high quality professionhe is very responsible and his teaching is easy to understand\xe3\x80\x82it was welli feel like they should be more engaging towards the students.i found this course very hard to follow. the lectures were not properly taught and the information was conveyed in a very confusingmanner. professor voznyy did not explain the concepts clearly at all. the lectures were rushed and mostly ended in about 30 mins.he skipped slides and did not even teach the calculation questions properly. the mid term was very difficult and the questions onintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/3/2020 4/15commentsthere did not reflect the in class material or the questions that were given to practice. i feel a lot of the time it was very hard to hearwhat he was saying. professor sullan taught the course with a lot more detail and explained the concepts better. i think that the herclass can be more intuitive as at times it feels very boring.the first half of the course was decent but the second half of the course felt a splurge of information being told to me without theproper use of it. the instructor talks way to fast in the lecture. the points and discussion she tries to make in the lectures fails tohelp me with my assignments that she assigns. for the assignments, i\'m better off studying the textbook then even considering herlecture notes which become confusing when trying to review her practice questions. in the assignments, she doesn\'t even providethe sections of the textbook the questions were based off so that students can review these questions from the assignments.the instruction in this course was clear and detailed.the first half of the semester the lectures were not engaging at all, we skipped over a lot of practice problems so i wasnt able tolearn how to do the questions properly. the midterm test was not fair to the kinds of questions we were being asked in class orfrom the fsgs, they were far more advanced even though i thoroughly prepared for the midterm.all instructors are extremely knowledgable about what they are teaching and do a good job of fully explaining themselves andanswering questions where there may be something that is unclear.first module was very boring to listen to, as he just leaned against the podium and read off slides. second module was betterbecause the prof recognized us and made sure we understood.although the content is hard to learn, the instruction made it easier to understandthe course instructors explained all topics clearly during the lectures. they included a lot of practice problems in their lessons,which helped me deepen my understanding of the material. as for the laboratory practicals: the knowledge i gained from the lectures was not always sufficient to help me complete theactivities in my lab notebook, and i often had to go to the chem help center for assistance. i felt that a lot of the material covered inthe labs did not clearly correspond to the lecture material. however, the lab material itself covered relatively simple concepts.it was hard to follow at the beginning (module 1) because most of the questions were calculation\xe2\x80\x93based questions and i feel likethe instructor should be more interactive with the material and the students, for instance, drawing and doing calculations with theclass instead of pictures of calculations that were somewhat confusing. however, overall, every instructor did a good job in ourweekly discussions.very very poor instruction especially from professor voznyy as he did not know what he was doing and did not care about hisprofession.although oleksandr\'s lectures were fairly boring, he was definitely the only instructor in this course that genuinely wanted thestudents to succeed. he often encouraged us to ask questions during lectures and come to his office hours. he openly discussedassignments during the spare time in lectures. he gave a decent indication of what material is testable throughout his lectures andhe organized his lectures schedules to allow for a review session before his midterm, also allowing students to vote on whichtopics they would like him to go over. his midterm was fairly difficult, however he did recognize that many students did poorly andopenly expressed that he did not want or expect students to be unsuccessful and was open to any feedback to improve this forfuture students.in contrast, i cannot say the same for ruby. many upper year students warned me about her being a terrible prof, including many ofmy ta\'s, and i unfortunately cannot say i had a different experience. in lecture, she would present practice questions that were nowhere near the difficulty level of her assignments and exam. she said openly in lecture that her exam is nearly impossible and sheis unsure if she will even provide us with a formula sheet, which is frankly essential considering the content of her portion of thecourse. it is fairly obvious that she does not want students to exceed and takes pride in the fact that her exam is so difficult. as aprofessor, your job is to teach the content and guide the students\' learning to help them be successful in their academic career, notto work hard to discourage and derail them for what they are trying to achieve. nirusha was very similar. she was very unapproachable the entire semester. several students have been contacted by a supposedacademic offence that was committed and nearly all of these students had complained about how it was just an error in theircalculations, but she insists on accusing many students of falsification. i will even go as far as to say she wanted to catchsomeone committing an ""academic offence"" for no reason other than pride and simply to scare students.the professors are very helpful but when it comes to assessments, i do not know who created them, but they can be tricky andsomewhat too heavy compare to the examples the lecture slides or the book provided. i know assessments supposed to challengeour comprehension and knowledge but most of the time i feel helpless, what i mean is that i thought i get the concepts, but whenim at the moment of completing the assessment just like the midterm, i feel like i do not know anything at all. i do not know what idon\'t know. that is what i usually feel after assessments. i was so thankful that administation thought about having chem aid thistime. it\'s just that its too late to know the right answer.quality of instruction was not thorough. i would have very much appreciated if ta\'s were helpful in passing on the necessaryinstructions.the instruction was good.in this class, i can learn some useful knowledge and the instructor is very kind.good quality of instructions although emails were answered lateintroductory chemistry ii

material.goodfsgs, help centrei believe that practice questions similarly to the difficulty to the exam should be provided. many of the questions provided were eithertoo easy (textbook) or too hard

professors had office hours to go get help. i feel that the chem help center was extremely helpful. the help center allowedme to go every week to get help for in class questions but also for lab difficulties and questions. i think the chem help center isone of the best resources available for chemistry students.the ta's were great help in understanding some concepts.chma11 fsgs were very helpful because it allowed me to see which topics i understood well and which ones i needed morepractice in. the chem\xe2\x80\x93aid centre was also helpful when i had questions about lab content.the fsgs did not relate to the kinds of questions we got on the midterm.the mastering chemistry questions were great to practice and check our understand as well as for preparing for the exams.further, both professor vonzyy and sullan provided multiple practice and example questions throughout their lectures which weremore than sufficient in allowing us to check our understanding of course concepts.prof hours were available for most of the weekhelp was highly accessible and helpful (fsgs, ta, etc.)dr. voznyy and dr. sullan were both very open to questions and i felt comfortable approaching them. furthermore, i also feltcomfortable asking them to implement my in\xe2\x80\x93course disability accommodations. (i am registered with accessability services.)they both agreed to give me advance notice of the lecture readings, which was extremely helpful to me throughout the course.i did not interact much with dr. thavarajah, but she did answer a few questions for me via email. the chem help center was very helpful to me.fsg, chem aidassist from external fsgs was readily available. poor office hours from professors.my ta, keuna, seemed very intimidating at first. however, she was actually very kind, helpful, and encouraging. she conducted thelab practicals in such a way that she did not give students answers, but also did not leave us completely confused, like some of myprevious tas. instead, she guided our thought process and helped us come to conclusions on our own. she was really open togiving us feedback to help us improve on future assessments in chma11 and the rest of our undergraduate degrees. lastly, shewas encouraged us to contact her with any questions and concerns, even after the closure of the university. i feel very fortunate tohave had her as my ta this semester.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/3/2020 6/15commentsthe chem aid center was very helpful.the chem aid. the professors are so helpful and i appreciate their efforts very much. the fsgsfor me, as a student there is something lacking about the process of sinking all of the concepts to my understanding. i do not knowif its only me who feel like this, but i feel like having tutorials aside from having lab experiments will be really helpful. fsg sessionsalways do conflict with my timetables, and i think those sessions are really helpful. fsgs provides us an opportunity to practice, askquestions among our peers, similar to tutorials, then why not make it as an official tutorial and maybe make it as a 5% of our grade.it will also help us be ready with mastering questions. with all due respect, these are only my suggestions, and i thank you forreading them. i really want to help other peers especially i the struggle among us studentsta's in this course did not seem very helpful. i felt like i had to figure everything out myself. the environment did not feel verystudent\xe2\x80\x93friendly. i felt like i was holding back due to the environment.fsgs and the chem aid center were a great help. office hours were also available for help.we have labs every two week, and we also have fsg, we discuss together and learn together.fair assistance""","b ' professor sullan was great as she provided practice problems frequently and went over topics to reiterate

although the professors provided thorough lectures presenting classmaterial , i believe that more time provided to examples ( going through examples ) would help student better\xe2\x80\x93understand concepts . its decent , not bad , but not 100% high quality professionhe is very responsible and his teaching is easy to understand\xe3\x80\x82it was welli feel xlike they should be more engaging towards the students . i found this course very hard to follow . the lectures were not properly taught and the information was conveyed in a very confusingmanner . professor voznyy did not explain the concepts clearly at all . the lectures were rushed and mostly ended in about 30 mins . he skipped slides and did not teach the calculation questions properly . the mid term was very difficult and the questions onintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/3/2020 4/15commentsthere did not reflect the in class material or the questions that were given to practice . i feel a lot of the time it was very hard to hearwhat he was saying . professor sullan taught the course with a lot more detail and explained the concepts better . i think that the herclass can be more intuitive as at times it feels very boring . the first half of the course was decent but the second half of the course felt a splurge of information being told to me (without) not theproper use of it . the instructor talks way to fast in the lecture . the points and discussion she tries to make in the lectures fails tohelp me with my assignments that she assigns . for the assignments , i\ am better off studying the textbook then even considering herlecture notes which become confusing when trying to review her practice questions . in the assignments , she doesn\' t even providethe sections of the textbook the questions were based off so that students can review these questions from the assignments . the instruction in this course was clear and detailed . the first half of the semester the lectures were not engaging at all , we skipped over a lot of practice problems so i wasnt able tolearn how to do the questions properly . the midterm test was not fair to the kinds of questions we were being asked in class orfrom the fsgs , they were far more advanced even though i thoroughly prepared for the midterm . all instructors are extremely knowledgable about what they are teaching and do a good job of fully explaining themselves andanswering questions where there may be something that is unclear . first module was very boring to listen to , as he just leaned against the podium and read off slides . second module was betterbecause the prof recognized us and made sure we understood . although the content is hard to learn , the instruction made it easier to understandthe course instructors explained all topics clearly during the lectures . they included a lot of practice problems in their lessons , hich helped me deepen my understanding of the material . as for the laboratory practicals : the knowledge i gained from the lectures was not sufficient to help me complete theactivities in my lab notebook , and i often had to go to the chem help center for assistance . i felt that a lot of the material covered inthe labs did not clearly correspond to the lecture material . however , the lab material itself covered relatively simple concepts . it was hard to follow at the beginning ( module 1 ) because most of the questions were calculation\xe2\x80\x93based questions and i feel likethe instructor should be more interactive with the material and the students , for instance , drawing and doing calculations with theclass instead of pictures of calculations that were somewhat confusing . however , overall , every instructor did a good job in ourweekly discussions . very very poor instruction especially from professor voznyy as he did not know what he was doing and did not care about hisprofession . although oleksandr\' s lectures were fairly boring , he was definitely the only instructor in this course that genuinely wanted thestudents to succeed . he often encouraged us to ask questions during lectures and come to his office hours . he openly discussedassignments during the spare time in lectures . he gave a decent indication of what material is testable throughout his lectures andhe organized his lectures schedules to allow for a review session before his midterm , also allowing students to vote on whichtopics they would like him to go over . his midterm was fairly difficult , however he did recognize that many students did poorly andopenly expressed that he did not want or expect students to be unsuccessful and was open to any feedback to improve this forfuture students . in contrast , i can not say the same for ruby . many upper year students warned me about her being a terrible prof , including many ofmy ta\' s , and i unfortunately can not say i had a different experience . in lecture , she would present practice questions that were nowhere near the difficulty level of her assignments and exam . she said openly in lecture that her exam is nearly impossible and sheis unsure if she will even provide us with a formula sheet , which is frankly essential considering the content of her portion of thecourse . it is fairly obvious that she does not want students to exceed and takes pride in the fact that her exam is so difficult . as aprofessor , your job is to teach the content and guide the students\' learning to help them be successful in their academic career , notto work hard to discourage and derail them for what they are trying to achieve . nirusha was very similar . she was very unapproachable the entire semester . several students have been contacted by a supposedacademic offence that was committed and nearly all of these students had complained about how it was just an error in theircalculations , but she insists on accusing many students of falsification . i will even go as far as to say she wanted to catchsomeone committing an "" academic offence "" for (no) not reason other than pride and simply to scare students . the professors are very helpful but when it comes to assessments , i do not know who created them , but they can be tricky andsomewhat too xheavy compare to the examples the lecture slides or the book provided . i know assessments supposed to challengeour comprehension and knowledge but most of the time i feel helpless , what i mean is that i thought i get the concepts , but whenim at the moment of completing the assessment just like the midterm , i feel xlike i do not know anything at all . i do not know what idon\' t know . that is what i usually feel after assessments . i was so thankful that administation thought about having chem aid thistime . it\' s just that its too xlate to know the right answer . quality of instruction was not thorough . i would have very much appreciated if ta\' s were helpful in passing on the necessaryinstructions . the instruction was good . in this class , i can learn some useful knowledge and the instructor is very kind . good quality of instructions although emails were answered

extramileexplaining them. i think the peer instruction qs in class are very helpful, i can also ask her qs on the spot. its basically like a practicesession. i also like speed that she covers the material even though i think it is a little slow, but i understand the materials on thespot, i dont have to review the material again to do practice problem from textbook. i also like the way she organized the concept andassessment, they are really clear.i really enjoyed the peer instruction portion of the course, it solidified the information during lecture making it easier to study athome.it was a good class. the peer instruction questions really are helpful, i loved them. prof. thavarajah is clear when she teaches andalways encourages us to do our best and practice.the overall quality of the instruction was excellent. it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to take this course and the professorwas great in terms of teaching the content and making sure that students understand the material thoroughly. the professor wasalso very helpful during office hours in terms of answering questions on the material. professor thavarajah is a fantastic professorwho is dedicated to helping students learn and get the most out of taking the course.nirusha is an amazing professor. other professors should take notes on how she does her lectures because she is able tothoroughly explain concepts and provide practice that enhances the knowledge.best prof ever, very fairi understand that this course is one of the more difficult courses but the professor and tas made it engaging and were easy toreach out too. i wish there was a set rubric that we could follow for our labs as it seemed like each ta had a different markingscheme. additionally, i hope that future students would get a chance to review their tutorial quizzes after they were marked or if thetas could take them up so that students know what mistakes they made.perfect. she\'s clear, takes her time, and is genuinely concerned with whether we\'re comprehending what she teaches.i took this course last semester but i dropped it because i was doing poorly. i was worried about taking it again this semester, butthavarajah took away my worries. she is an amazing teacher, i was able to understand concepts that i had trouble understandingbefore. the pacing of every lecture is great, i am able to follow along. my favourite part of lecture was the peer instruction questions.it\'s a great way of practice and making sure you understood what was taught. it was also good preparation for the exam. i enjoyedthe labs, the lab quizzes were fair. i thought the tutorial quizzes were mostly fair, but i would have liked a few more minutes tocomplete them, perhaps 15 min instead of 10 min. i have struggled with chemistry in the past, but thavarajah was able to make thecontent understandable, and when it made sense it was fun to learn.the overall quality of the instruction was very good. the content of the course was delivered in an effective and engaging manner.the method of instruction (peer instruction questions) were really helpful as it helped provide a better understanding of the coursematerial.this course, organic chemistry, which i used to think dull and hard becomes quite interesting thanks to prof nirusha.professor thavarajah explained the concepts very well. i liked how more time was spent on the harder chapters (towards the end)with more challenging ""peer instruction"" questions. overall, i really enjoyed this course.there was a lot of practice questions done in class which really helped demonstrate the concepts learned.i think it was very helpful to go over the questions in detail during office hours.the professor was very clear in terms of instructions provided through quercus by sending very consistent reminder emails and ithelped people to keep in check of all the deadlines.i have taken this course 4 times before and having nirusha as a professor made a huge difference. she goes through the lecture ata good pace, she also lets students work on problems in class, i think this is very important in consolidating knowledge. in additionshe provides many practice questions to reinforce concepts later on.the instruction was very good, topics are clearly explained and made clear what we needed to know for the exam.the professor was very good at explaining the concept in this course. she would have peer\xe2\x80\x93instruction which helped a lot with myunderstanding as it would make me practice right after i learned the topic. to add on, the professor did not rush any topic, she madesure everyone understood what was happening before moving on. the professor also tried to teach us patterns in organicchemistry instead of memorizing the concepts.always a pleasure having professor thavarajah. her quizzes and exams always based on what we\'ve learned and done in class,very fair, no surprises. informative lectures and very helpful peer instruction segments to make sure the material is beingunderstood.amazing instructor!lots of extra office hours available. the class had many interesting and stimulating peer instruction questions which were veryuseful and helpful for the course and learning process.organic chemistry i chmb41h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/3/2020 4/16commentsprofessor nirusha was an excellent professor for the course. her teaching style and tactics made the course material easier theunderstand and digest. her tutorials made sure we kept up with course material and that we understood the central principles

class. lecture material and slides are very clear and well\xe2\x80\x93elaborated on in class.concepts are thoroughly explained.i had heard horror stories about this course and i was so scared coming into it, but after finishing two thirds of the course, i\'mactually looking forward to taking part 2 (especially if the professor is the same). the professor gave so many opportunities tounderstand the concepts and clear up any misunderstandings not only in class, but also in office hours. she was always veryhelpful and never made me feel like i couldn\'t ask her questions. in addition, she went at a perfect pace where it didn\'t seem asthough we were rushing through any concepts and yet were still able to complete the chapters on time. i really feel like theprofessor cared more about us fully understanding the material rather than just trying to hurry through everything on the syllabus.the instruction of the class was well with the many discussion questions. however, in the tutorials there was not much time to askand clear questions as it seemed too rushed. the lab equipment were not at its best condition where some of the equipment keptcoming loose and eventually breaking later on in the lab like the water piping in the fumehood. the labs were very long and we wereonly able to finish by extreme rushing.organic chemistry i chmb41h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/3/2020 5/168. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course.comments'","b""lots of assistance was there to support my learning in class, each classi think she is a really helpful and approachable prof if you have any questions. but i do hope she is more responsive with onlineemails.prof. thavarajah's office hours were great and always busy. she did her best to get to everyones questions in a timely manner eventhough it was tough. my ta, celia, was excellent. she's very smart and knows exactly what she's doing. she was always positive and encouraged usconstantly. amazing ta.i found tutorial worksheets helpful un learningi viewed the lab seminar slides online and found that i would have benefitted a little more if i actually attended the seminars inpersonoffice hours right after lecture \xe2\x80\x93 extremely helpfulthavarajah was available to answer questions any time during class, she has office hours, and you can email her. tas from thetutorial and lab were also available to provide support. there were lab skills seminars which were very helpful.thank you my practical ta amad who helped me so much during experimentpeer instruction questions were very helpful.the tutorials were meant to aid in practice. the prof would always make herself avaible to answer any questionsprofessor's office hours were very helpful in terms of providing people with better understanding of course concepts.nirusha as well as the teaching assistants made themselves available through office hours and emailsthere was a lot of assistance in this course. the professor had many office hours and she always tried to accommodate sometime by giving appointments or by making her office hours longer to make sure everyone can get all the help they need.tas and office hoursn/apractice questions in an out of lectures were extremely helpful, and so were question assignments from the textbook. tutorials alsoenhanced learning. professor thavarajah was extremely accessible for help and to answer questions.my lab ta (syed) was okay. he was very friendly and helpful but he got confused easily which lead to me being confused as well.this was in part, i believe, due to the fact that some of the instruction in the lab manual was so confusing and i don't blame him forthat. however, he sometimes gave bad advice to me and my partner on information that i feel he should've already known. the lab manual was very confusing and resulted in me and my partner extremely messing up one of our labs because theprocedure in the manual was not chronological. in addition, it was very difficult, messy and confusing to have to put certain parts ofthe pre\xe2\x80\x93 and post\xe2\x80\x93lab on specific pages. also, there was one lab where me and my partner was supposed to do the entire labtogether but in one notebook. this doesn't make much sense as we both need the information. the tutorial tas (daniel and rebecca) were not very helpful as they never actually helped to clear up any questions and they didn'tseem very knowledgeable about the subject. they just gave us the worksheet/quizzes and then marked them. i never actuallylearned anything in the tutorials. i found rebecca more helpful than daniel because at least she tried to explain some things whiledaniel would give us a 'hint' and then tell us that he'll leave the rest to us even though we didn't know what to do.""","b ' i was given the opportunity to learn in this coursei think prof nirusha is really really nice in person . she is really helpful if you have any

quality","b'excellentyour average chem course, pretty much exactly what i expected. good profs, office hours available and tas very helpfulthe overall quality of course was good. the way in which the course was delivered was helpful, and not too difficult to follow.it was difficult to connect the readings and the content of the lectures together. the lectures felt very rushed sometimes. i found theexplanations to be a bit confusing sometimes.i loved marco\'s part of the module as he was pretty engaging and straightforward with his content. as far as profssor xiao\xe2\x80\x93an isconcerned, i struggled to understand a good part of his content because the audio was not super clear. i would appreciate if hecould go over more examples too.the overall quality of the instruction of this course was not very well done. i really liked the clutch prep assignments at the end ofeach chapter as well as the practice problems posted by the professors. also, i appreciated professor marco having synchronousclasses during the semester, however, i found the pace of the course to be very fast. also, there were too many pictures and wordson the slides which made it difficult to grasp the core concepts. also, i appreciated the review of each lecture that professor xiao\xe2\x80\x93anhad at the beginning of each lecture, however, i found that lectures were not as engaging. i found it difficult to sit through the 1 hourlectures. with that said, one piece of feedback the i have is that the professors could work to make their lectures more engagingand interactive because i found it difficult to pay attention at times.the quality of the course instruction was good, the lectures and instructions were easy to follow and the workload was fair.it\xe2\x80\x99s was somewhat hard to understanddespite the difficulty of the material, the professors were able to get it through. they always provided examples and manyopportunities to ask for clarification.overall quality was greatthe course always provides high\xe2\x80\x93quality course materials and activities.fun course to take, a bit rushed, like the material was being crammed into one semester when it should have been two, but thequick pace kept me on my toes and interested in continuing.the overall quality was great. i was happy with how the lectures were conducted in prof. marco\'s module as they helped me stay ontop of lectures, and any questions i had were answered during lectures by either other students or by prof. marco himself. in prof.zhang\'s module, the q&a sessions helped me develop a better understanding of the content we covered in his pre\xe2\x80\x93recordedlectures. the lectures were very detailed too, and they helped a great deal in forming concepts as well.the overall quality of this course was good.excellent course. the professors are engaging and interesting to listen to. very interested in the subject matter.fun course, fair assessmentsi really liked the lectures, they were very interesting. some lectures were boring and made it hard to concentrate, which madelearning a bit difficult. overall, the course was very fun and challenging.overall it was a great learning experience. however, for professor zhang\'s section of the course, some of the readings suggestedin the syllabus did not fully cover the content discussed in the lectures (especially true for chapter 11 and 19). personally, i like toread ahead so it was surprising when the professor covered sections in the textbook which were not suggested in the syllabus aspart of the suggested readings.the instructors have comprehensively explained complex concepts with related mini questions to expand learning.quercus was well organized and easy to navigate through. professors were also very accommodating and would explain content ina way that my understanding of the material significantly improved. the course was well paced and did not feel like it was rushed.what was expected of us for exams and labs and assignments were fully outlined in the instructions and the professors would alsofurther explain and make clear the instructions through announcements.i did not like that the course switched instructors and methods of delivery halfway through the course. besides that, the instruction ofthe course was very detailed and the examples of questions given in lectures allowed for a better understanding of conceptslearned in the course. in addition, the online lab experiments allowed me to check my understanding of the material we learned inthe course and further my understanding of the material without the addition pressure of carrying out an actual lab in person.the quality was goodthe lecture were sometimes difficult to follow.this course was taught by two professors and i thought that was a good aspect of this course as it helps students adapt to thedifferent teaching styles of the professors. the course was also chunked out well between the professors where one of theprofessors covered mostly the review and introduction of new chemistry topics at the university level while the second professorbuilds on that foundation and goes into depth into the university level topics as well as preparing us for future chemistry courses atutsc.introductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-2021-12-06 4/20commentsit was a decent course.excellentthe lecture videos could have captions or could be more louder. some practice questions can be reviewed during class. we weregiven lots of lectures notes, and recorded lectures.the instruction was the best that could come out of an online course. the online aspect of it was overall not great.the instruction is clear, though the chemistry is a abstract subject. at the beginning, i thought it is a little hard for me. but followingeverything became better!both instructors for both modules explained concepts very clearly during lectures, and were very helpful during office hours.overall, the course provided a great deal of knowledge that gave students a chance to expand their knowledge of chemistry and fullycapture each concept. the instructors provided different ways so we can fully capture each concept and made it more clear witheach lecture and video brought out.the concepts taught were very interesting and presented in a very logical manner. the instructors were also very proficient inclarifying points of confusion as well as preventing this confusion from arising.found the course to be intellectually stimulatinginstructions were provided both live in lectures and as emails. excellent communication of instructions between the professors andthe students.the concepts were explained clearly but could be a little confusing at times.they were detailed, clear, and concisegoodvery quick but that was expectedduring marco\'s module i found that live lectures as well as the option of watching his lectures really helped students. marcoexplained things quickly and specifically and to me, his the content as well as the pace of it was just right for me but i can\'t say thesame for others. for professor xiao\xe2\x80\x93an i found it a little hard to stay engaged with his lectures. i did like his practice example foundin his lectures.the overall quality of the course was quite good.i understood and further improved my learning in this course. i greatly enjoyed my practical and watching the lectures as it waseasily understandable. the provided slides were also very helpful.with covid, it can be hard to teach remotely, but professor zimmer\xe2\x80\x93de luliis taught the course synchronously with greateffectiveness. i really liked his lectures and they strengthened my understanding in chemistry. professor zhang taught his lecturesgood. although they were asynchronous he was still able to deliver the lecture content. the tas did a great job with leading the lablessons.very goodfor each assignment or test, the instructions were always clear and accessible to all students.goodgoodgood.the course was well instructed, with timely announcements and helpful resources being presented.the instructors of the course did quite well with their teaching abilities and helped me in my earning experience.i thoroughly enjoyed this course not only because i love chemistry, but also because the instructors made it so engaging andinteresting. the lectures were delivered in 2 formats \xe2\x80\x93 live in the first half of the semester, and recorded for the second half, but ienjoyed both methods of lecture delivery. the instructors made the course content engaging to follow and helped me learn moreabout chemistry. the labs, though virtual, were also well\xe2\x80\x93designed and easy to follow and gave an idea of what to expect in the labonce we return to in\xe2\x80\x93person classes and labs. i thoroughly enjoyed the writing assignment as it gave me an opportunity to explore atopic within chemistry, and do my own research as well as provide feedback to my peers. this helped me develop skills that i canuse later on in my undergraduate courses in scientific report writing. overall, i really enjoyed this course as it has a high quality ofinstruction, and would definitely recommend this course to other students!under the current circumstances (covid), i think both the live lectures and recorded videos were a good option.instruction was clear and helpful, if they weren\'t we had many chances near the end of the lecture or during office hours to getclarification.the first professor in this course did not make the atmosphere enjoyable for learning at all and made concepts difficult tounderstand. i considered dropping this class but unfortunately i needed it for my major going forward. the writing activity didn\'tcontribute to my understanding of chemistry at all and felt completely irrelevant. the second professor was much better atintroductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-2021-12-06 5/20commentsexplaining concepts but the hour\xe2\x80\x93long lectures were difficult to stay engaged with. the tests only being 20 questions each make itdifficult to obtain grades that reflect my overall understanding of the material. i had a poor experience with this course unfortunately. ihave been consistently stressed due to this course as well as the upcoming final exam.i really liked when the course was synchronous as we were able to genuinely interact and ask questions surrounding lecturematerial. some of the information is new so it can be presented in a way that is a little confusing, but overall i feel like i waspresented good information in our time together.the content was easily comprehensible, however, some lectures were very filled with content with not a lot of room for explanation.some lectures were also not very engaging.very specific and understandablei think the live lectures were more conducive to my understanding of the content more than the asynchronous lectures.it was great.i really enjoyed the overall quality of the instruction in this course particulary professor marco\'s section because i enjoyed histeaching method and the way he relayed the course content to the students.for the synchronous lectures, during module 1, i was very clear about what i was learning and didn\'t have much difficulty. however,with module 2, i felt that the shift to asynchronous learned really impacted how i was learning the material. i felt like the informationthat was presented went in one ear and out the other, making it very difficult to understand.very detailed and step\xe2\x80\x93by\xe2\x80\x93step instructions were provided throughout the course which really helped me follow throughassignments, lectures, labs and etc. the overall quality of instructions we\'re greatthe instruction quality i feel was higher in the first half of the course than in the second half\xe2\x80\x93 i seemed to be a lot more confusedabout the concepts and struggled more with understanding the longer lecturesthe instructions in this course was fairly straightforward.minimal enthusiasm towards content coming from instructors most of the time.i felt this course to be very content heavy, and things seem to move way too fast. i understand that this is the pace of university but forstudents who just got here, it made it very difficult to succeed in this course. all professors were pretty good and explained thingswell, it was just really hard to take in all this information and be able to understand it well as many of the question were moreapplication based.the lectures were easy to understand the profs would explain further if we had any queries.the several practice problems implemented in each slide deck were incredibly beneficial to my learning. i also enjoyed theparticipolls in the first half. these polls and their discussions helped me identify common mistakes made by other students (or insome cases, myself), which i would then take note of, so that i do not make those mistakes myself.moreover, the review at the beginning of the lectures were greatly appreciated.finally, the weekly updates ""insights into chemistry"" were interesting in the sense that it provided insight in what a career inchemistry may look like.sometimes the material on the lectures was explained in an overly complex way, but the professors explained it well most of thetime.overall the instructions in this course were easy and understandable.good.overall quality of the instruction in this course was thoroughly explained.i liked when the lectures were synchronized, so the lectures were easy to follow. i really liked annotation as my style of learning.slides were constructed well.i found that the switch in professors went a lot smoother than i expected. i understood the teaching of both professors and reallyappreciated their pacing and their explanation. they were both equally engaging in class, although the first prof did go a little fast,the fact that the lectures were recorded were a great help.wish the pace of the course could be slower as it was hard to catch upgood\xef\xbc\x81the instructions were given very clearly and videos were sometimes provided.the lectures at first were a little fast, but that was to get enough material possible in the hour that we had. the essay that we did atthe beginning of the year didn\xe2\x80\x99t really affect me, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense how the strict deadlines were constantly pushed back forthose who did their essay last minute. it was unfair to those and myself who did it on time without the extension. i did enjoy theclutch assignments because it helped me understand the topic a lot better. it provided a video after every question to show how todo it and why the answer is correct or wrong.i believe that the overall quality of the instruction in this course is fair. this is because most of the concepts are easy to understand.though i wished that the recordings would come with captions or a readable transcript.introductory chemistry i chma10h3-f-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-2021-12-06 6/20commentsthe ta of my practical section\xe2\x80\x93 stephen ho, was really hard to understand and i never understood anything during labs, neverlearned anything for his way of speaking. wish he would put a bit more effort on speaking in a clearer way. he pronounced most ofthe things wrong so i couldn\'t have a grasp on what he was teaching. his slides weren\'t much helpful either.this course was enjoyable, sometimes it felt rushed but i feel like i was able to learn alot. the labs were lot\'s of fun!overall this course contains a lot of complicated concepts and terms\xcd\xbe however, the professor explains them thoroughly and thus aresuper helpful in terms of understanding. the materials are detailed and well explained.professor marco was the only professor i had this semester that provided online, synchronous classes which was excellent aspeople could ask questions and we did practice problems together. the other professors were great in their lectures as well andare pretty detailed in their explanations. they give plenty of real life examples and applications which makes it easier to understandoverall, i was very well supported in my learning experience by professor marco. as someone who was taking chemistry as anelective out of pure interest in learning more, prof. marco was always approachable via email and during office hours + chemistsconsuming coffee sessions. professor marco\'s lectures were very interesting and kept me very well engaged. professor zhang was also approachable and held office hours regularly etc. however, i did not feel very intellectually stimulatedduring his lectures. i am not sure if it is because of the content. i felt the lectures were monotonous and sometimes overlycomplicated concepts that could have been explained in a much simpler way to an intro. to chem class. i say this because when isought help from a friend who had a better background in chemistry than i did, they were able to adequately and simply explainthese concepts to me, without some of the extra information which added to the confusion during lectures. overall, i do thinkstudents could benefit from more engaging and less complicated lectures during the second half of the course.i think macro\'s tutoring speed is too fast, especially at the beginning of the course. it would be better if the content could beexplained more concisely and give more examples.the midterms were unnecessarily difficult.the change from one prof to another was most definitely jarring, as the starting lectures seemed info light, and very much exampleheavy, while xiao\xe2\x80\x93an posted essentially a dubbed over slideshow of bricks of text. extreme opposite style as this was all info,maybe a diagram to solidify understanding. i did worse on the latter portion, but feel i learned more.i had difficulty following along with lectures at times, and the organization and categorization of lectures were difficult to navigate. idon\'t really feel that this is an issue with the instructors, more so a symptom of online learning.lectures were deliberated in an unorganized fashion, from switching to synchronously to asynchronously. furthermore, theexpectations of the workload were quite chaotic.this course had helped me understand the importance of time management. the essay assignment was one of the bestintellectually stimulating assignments this semester with fair grading and good feedback by the ta.the professors have quite different class atmosphere, but both encouraging participation of students, and both delivering thelectures with dedications. i do like how the professors connect the course wisely with history of chemistry, chemistry in real life, andpractices with the contents of the delivery, because they do help me gain more knowledge and enhance

clutchprep also helped me understand the content better.my ta has been a great help with any confusion related to the course and the instructor's office hours allowed students to join andclarify confusions.as someone who was very scared to take any chemistry course as i never took chemistry in grade 12 and was only able to get an80 on the dot in grade 11 chemistry this course was taught so well and improved my knowledge significantly. clutch, office hoursand tutorials all played a huge role in improving my knowledge. though this may seem like a lot of work to other students, the videolessons can be mandatory or there can be some sort of rule where if someone does the video lesson the weight factor ofsomething else can be less. i say this because the clutch video lessons also really improved my knowledge and made the contenteasier to understand. i strongly believe that other students would benefit greatly from using the video lessons. finally, they providedus with extensions but sometimes this was provided on the day of the deadline or after so it would have been useful if theyannounced it a little earlier.there were office hours, facilitated study groups, online classes and tutorials where students could ask questions about conceptsthat we have learned or ask questions about assigned homework.it would have been better if they elaborated on previous topics as a refresher instead of directly expecting us to remember each andevery aspect of things we learned several months agothe tas could have explained the lecture material better.tasmany

excellentyour average chem course , pretty much exactly what i expected . good profs , office hours available and tas very helpfulthe overall quality of course was good . the way in which the course was delivered was helpful , and not difficult to follow . it was difficult to connect the readings and the content of the lectures together . the lectures felt very rushed sometimes . i found theexplanations to be a bit confusing sometimes . i loved marco\' s part of the module as he was pretty engaging and straightforward with his content . as far as profssor xiao\xe2\x80\x93an isconcerned , i struggled to understand a good part of his content because the audio was not super clear . i would appreciate if hecould go over more examples xtoo . the overall quality of the instruction of this course was not well done . i really liked the clutch prep assignments at the end ofeach chapter as xwell as the practice problems posted by the professors . also , i appreciated professor marco having synchronousclasses during the semester , however , i found the pace of the course to be very fast . also , there were too xmany pictures and wordson the slides which made it difficult to grasp the core concepts . also , i appreciated the review of each lecture that professor xiao\xe2\x80\x93anhad at the beginning of each lecture , however , i found that lectures were not engaging . i found it difficult to sit through the 1 hourlectures . with that said , one piece of feedback the i have is that the professors could work to make their lectures more engagingand interactive because i found it difficult to pay attention at times . the quality of the course instruction was good , the lectures and instructions were easy to follow and the workload was fair . it\xe2\x80\x99s was somewhat hard to understanddespite the difficulty of the material , the professors were able to get it through . they always provided examples and manyopportunities to ask for clarification . overall quality was greatthe course always provides high\xe2\x80\x93quality course materials and activities . fun course to take , a bit rushed , like the material was being crammed into one semester when it should have been two , but thequick pace kept me on my toes and interested in continuing . the overall quality was great . i was happy with how the lectures were conducted in prof . marco\' s module as they helped me stay ontop of lectures , and any questions i had were answered during lectures by either other students or by prof . marco himself . in prof . zhang\' s module , the q&a sessions helped me develop a better understanding of the content we covered in his pre\xe2\x80\x93recordedlectures . the lectures were very detailed xtoo and they helped a xgreat deal in forming concepts as xwell . the overall quality of this course was good . excellent course . the professors are engaging and interesting to listen to . very interested in the subject matter . fun course , fair assessmentsi really liked the lectures , they were very interesting . some lectures were boring and made it hard to concentrate , which madelearning a bit difficult . overall , the course was very fun and challenging . overall it was a great learning experience . however , for professor zhang\' s section of the course , some of the readings suggestedin the syllabus did not cover the content discussed in the lectures ( especially true for chapter 11 and 19 ) . personally , i like toread ahead so it was surprising when the professor covered sections in the textbook which were not suggested in the syllabus aspart of the suggested readings . the instructors have comprehensively explained complex concepts with related mini questions to expand learning . quercus was well organized and easy to navigate through . professors were also very accommodating and would explain content ina way that my understanding of the material significantly improved . the course was well paced and did not xlike it was rushed . what was expected of us for exams and labs and assignments were fully outlined in the instructions and the professors would alsofurther explain and make clear the instructions through announcements . i did not like that the course switched instructors and methods of delivery halfway through the course . besides that , the instruction ofthe course was very detailed and the examples of questions given in lectures allowed for a better understanding of conceptslearned in the course . in addition , the online lab experiments allowed me to check my understanding of the material we learned inthe course and further my understanding of the material (without) not addition pressure of carrying out an actual lab in person . the quality was goodthe lecture were sometimes difficult to follow . this course was taught by two professors and i thought that was a good aspect of this course as it helps students adapt to thedifferent teaching styles of the professors . the course was also chunked out well between the professors where one of theprofessors covered mostly the review and introduction of new chemistry topics at the university level while the second professorbuilds on that foundation and goes into depth into the university level topics as xwell as preparing us for future chemistry courses atutsc . introductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 2021 - 12 - 06 4/20commentsit was a decent course . excellentthe lecture videos could have captions or could be more louder . some practice questions can be reviewed during class . we weregiven lots of lectures notes , and recorded lectures . the instruction was the best that could come out of an online course . the online aspect of it was overall not great . the instruction is clear , though the chemistry is a abstract subject . at the beginning , i thought it is a xlittle hard for me . but followingeverything became better ! both instructors for both modules explained concepts very clearly during lectures , and were very helpful during office hours . overall , the course provided a xgreat deal of knowledge that gave students a chance to expand their knowledge of chemistry and fullycapture each concept . the instructors provided different ways so we can fully capture each concept and made it more clear witheach lecture and video brought out . the concepts taught were very interesting and presented in a very logical manner . the instructors were also very proficient inclarifying points of confusion as xwell as preventing this confusion from arising . found the course to be intellectually stimulatinginstructions were provided both live in lectures and as emails . excellent communication of instructions between the professors andthe students . the concepts were explained clearly but could be a xlittle confusing at times . they were detailed , clear , and concisegoodvery quick but that was expectedduring marco\' s module i found that live lectures as xwell as the option of watching his lectures really helped students . marcoexplained things quickly and specifically and to me , his the content as xwell as the pace of it was just right for me but i can\' t say thesame for others . for professor xiao\xe2\x80\x93an i found it a xlittle hard to stay engaged with his lectures . i did like his practice example foundin his lectures . the overall quality of the course was quite good . i understood and further improved my learning in this course . i greatly enjoyed my practical and watching the lectures as it waseasily understandable . the provided slides were also very helpful . with covid , it can be hard to teach remotely , but professor zimmer\xe2\x80\x93de luliis taught the course synchronously with greateffectiveness . i really liked his lectures and they strengthened my understanding in chemistry . professor zhang taught his lecturesgood . although they were asynchronous he was still able to deliver the lecture content . the tas did a great job with leading the lablessons . very goodfor each assignment or test , the instructions were always clear and accessible to all students . goodgoodgood . the course was well instructed , with timely announcements and helpful resources being presented . the instructors of the course did quite well with their teaching abilities and helped me in my earning experience . i thoroughly enjoyed this course not only because i love chemistry , but also because the instructors made it so engaging andinteresting . the lectures were delivered in 2 formats \xe2\x80\x93 live in the first half of the semester , and recorded for the second half , but ienjoyed both methods of lecture delivery . the instructors made the course content engaging to follow and helped me learn moreabout chemistry . the labs , though virtual , were also well\xe2\x80\x93designed and easy to follow and gave an idea of what to expect in the labonce we return to in\xe2\x80\x93person classes and labs . i thoroughly enjoyed the writing assignment as it gave me an opportunity to explore atopic within chemistry , and do my own research as xwell as provide feedback to my peers . this helped me develop skills that i canuse later on in my undergraduate courses in scientific report writing . overall , i really enjoyed this course as it has a high quality ofinstruction , and would definitely recommend this course to other students ! under the current circumstances ( covid ) , i think both the live lectures and recorded videos were a good option . instruction was clear and helpful , if they weren\' t we had many chances near the end of the lecture or during office hours to getclarification . the first professor in this course did not atmosphere enjoyable for learning at all and made concepts difficult tounderstand . i considered dropping this class but unfortunately i needed it for my major going forward . the writing activity didn\' tcontribute to my understanding of chemistry at all and felt completely irrelevant . the second professor was much better atintroductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 2021 - 12 - 06 5/20commentsexplaining concepts but the hour\xe2\x80\x93long lectures were difficult to stay engaged with . the tests only being 20 questions each make itdifficult to obtain grades that reflect my overall understanding of the material . i had a poor experience with this course unfortunately . ihave been consistently stressed due to this course as xwell as the upcoming final exam . i really liked when the course was synchronous as we were able to genuinely interact and ask questions surrounding lecturematerial . some of the information is new so it can be presented in a way that is a xlittle confusing , but overall i feel xlike i waspresented good information in our time together . the content was easily comprehensible , however , some lectures were very filled with content with not lot of room for explanation . some lectures were also not engaging . very specific and understandablei think the live lectures were more conducive to my understanding of the content more than the asynchronous lectures . it was great . i really enjoyed the overall quality of the instruction in this course particulary professor marco\' s section because i enjoyed histeaching method and the way he relayed the course content to the students . for the synchronous lectures , during module 1 , i was very clear about what i was learning and didn\' t have much difficulty . however , ith module 2 , i felt that the shift to asynchronous learned really impacted how i was learning the material . i felt xlike the informationthat was presented went in one ear and out the other , making it very difficult to understand . very detailed and step\xe2\x80\x93by\xe2\x80\x93step instructions were provided throughout the course which really helped me follow throughassignments , lectures , labs and etc . the overall quality of instructions we\ are greatthe instruction quality i feel was higher in the first half of the course than in the second half\xe2\x80\x93 i seemed to be a lot more confusedabout the concepts and struggled more with understanding the longer lecturesthe instructions in this course was fairly straightforward . minimal enthusiasm towards content coming from instructors most of the time . i felt this course to be very content heavy , and things seem to move way too xfast . i understand that this is the pace of university but forstudents who just got here , it made it very difficult to succeed in this course . all professors were pretty good and explained thingswell , it was just really hard to take in all this information and be able to understand it well as many of the question were moreapplication based . the lectures were easy to understand the profs would explain further if we had any queries . the several practice problems implemented in each slide deck were incredibly beneficial to my learning . i also enjoyed theparticipolls in the first half . these polls and their discussions helped me identify common mistakes made by other students ( or insome cases , myself ) , which i would then take note of , so that i do not those mistakes myself . moreover , the review at the beginning of the lectures were greatly appreciated . finally , the weekly updates "" insights into chemistry "" were interesting in the xsense that it provided insight in what a career inchemistry may look xlike . sometimes the material on the lectures was explained in an overly complex way , but the professors explained it well most of thetime . overall the instructions in this course were easy and understandable . good . overall quality of the instruction in this course was thoroughly explained . i liked when the lectures were synchronized , so the lectures were easy to follow . i really liked annotation as my style of learning . slides were constructed well . i found that the switch in professors went a lot smoother than i expected . i understood the teaching of both professors and reallyappreciated their pacing and their explanation . they were both equally engaging in class , although the first prof did go a xlittle fast , he fact that the lectures were recorded were a great help . wish the pace of the course could be slower as it was hard to catch upgood\xef\xbc\x81the instructions were given very clearly and videos were sometimes provided . the lectures at first were a xlittle fast , but that was to get enough material possible in the hour that we had . the essay that we did atthe beginning of the year didn\xe2\x80\x99t really affect me , it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense how the strict deadlines were constantly pushed back forthose who did their essay last minute . it was unfair to those and myself who did it on time (without) not extension . i did enjoy theclutch assignments because it helped me understand the topic a lot better . it provided a video after every question to show how todo it and why the answer is correct or wrong . i believe that the overall quality of the instruction in this course is fair . this is because most of the concepts are easy to understand . though i wished that the recordings would come with captions or a readable transcript . introductory chemistry i chma10h3 - f - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 2021 - 12 - 06 6/20commentsthe ta of my practical section\xe2\x80\x93 stephen ho , was really hard to understand and i (never) not understood anything during labs , neverlearned anything for his way of speaking . wish he would put a bit more effort on speaking in a clearer way . he pronounced most ofthe things wrong so i couldn\' t have a grasp on what he was teaching . his slides weren\' t much helpful either . this course was enjoyable , sometimes it felt rushed but i feel xlike i was able to learn alot . the labs were lot\' s of fun ! overall this course contains a lot of complicated concepts and terms\xcd\xbe however , the professor explains them thoroughly and thus aresuper helpful in terms of understanding . the materials are detailed and well explained . professor marco was the only professor i had this semester that provided online , synchronous classes which was excellent aspeople could ask questions and we did practice problems together . the other professors were great in their lectures as xwell andare pretty detailed in their explanations . they give plenty of real life examples and applications which makes it easier to understandoverall , i was very well supported in my learning experience by professor marco . as someone who was taking chemistry as anelective out of pure interest in learning more , prof . marco was always approachable via email and during office hours + chemistsconsuming coffee sessions . professor marco\' s lectures were very interesting and kept me very well engaged . professor zhang was also approachable and held office hours regularly etc . however , i did not intellectually stimulatedduring his lectures . i am not sure if it is because of the content . i felt the lectures were monotonous and sometimes overlycomplicated concepts that could have been explained in a much simpler way to an intro . to chem class . i say this because when isought help from a friend who had a better background in chemistry than i did , they were able to adequately and simply explainthese concepts to me , (without) not some of the extra information which added to the confusion during lectures . overall , i do thinkstudents could benefit from more engaging and (less) not complicated lectures during the second half of the course . i think macro\' s tutoring speed is too xfast , especially at the beginning of the course . it would be better if the content could beexplained more concisely and give more examples . the midterms were unnecessarily difficult . the change from one prof to another was most definitely jarring , as the starting lectures seemed info light , and very much exampleheavy , while xiao\xe2\x80\x93an posted essentially a dubbed over slideshow of bricks of text . extreme opposite style as this was all info , aybe a diagram to solidify understanding . i did worse on the latter portion , but feel i learned more . i had difficulty following along with lectures at times , and the organization and categorization of lectures were difficult to navigate . idon\' t really feel that this is an issue with the instructors , more so a symptom of online learning . lectures were deliberated in an unorganized fashion , from switching to synchronously to asynchronously . furthermore , theexpectations of the workload were quite chaotic . this course had helped me understand the importance of time management . the essay assignment was one of the bestintellectually stimulating assignments this semester with fair grading and good feedback by the ta . the professors have quite different class atmosphere , but both encouraging participation of students , and both delivering thelectures with dedications . i do like how the professors connect the course wisely with history of chemistry , chemistry in real life , andpractices with the contents of the delivery , because they do help me gain more knowledge and enhance my understanding of thecourse . high qualitywith all respect , professor xiaoan zhang\' s accent is pretty thick , so it was often hard to understand him , which made meconcentrate (less) not his lectures . concepts could have been explained betterthe class has lot of material but even then , the professors go at the students pace . most of the time , the concepts were taught indepth and with examples that we understand . when people asked questions , the profs were eager to help : ) very good quality .

very clearly and it reflects in the way sheteaches\xcd\xbe she is passionate and really wants her students to succeed.great explanation of the topic. help me understand topics covered in other classesprofessor thavarajah did an amazing job delivering content for this course. really liked the practice questions during lectures thatallowed for a chance to apply what we\'ve just learn into applications.i like the way dr. thavarajah broke down each lecture into three learning goals. not only does this help me to have an idea of what iam going to learn, but it also makes me review the course materials much easier as it helps me organize my notes. i alsoappreciate that i have chances to do the practise problems at the end of the lecture so that i can consolidate newmechanisms/concepts learnt from the lecture. the explanation of new mechanisms/concepts is very thorough and well\xe2\x80\x93paced, i can always understand and digest it before goingto the next section. the lab component is consistent with the lecture materials which again reinforce my knowledge while performing the experiments. iget to practise my analyzing skills on nmr, gc\xe2\x80\x93ms, tlc, ir, etc in the formal lab report. i can now fluently write a lab report thanksto the extensive practice from it. i would suggest that the pre\xe2\x80\x93lab quiz can be opened up a bit earlier so that i can work on that inadvance. i appreciated that i get to choose my topic for the literature assignment. i remembered in chmc41, i do not have the option tochoose the topic on my own. by choosing the topics that interest me, i had more motivation while doing the research online. i wouldsuggest setting up a peer\xe2\x80\x93review session prior to the final submission (like an earlier deadline for a draft version and assignedpeer review on the draft). by reviewing others\' papers, i can see how others structure their papers and provide insightful commentsas well. sometimes it is hard to spot some issues from the perspective of the writer. i believe that by doing so, the overall quality ofthe literature assignment can be better. the quizzes for the in\xe2\x80\x93person lab are straightforward and easy to understand. the quiz for the virtual lab required some researchonline since some of the knowledge was not mentioned in the lab manuals. (like propose a mechanism for a reaction, or like whydna has thymine instead of uracil) those questions have moderate difficulties and require some thinking and effort to come upwith a good answer.the difficulty of the midterm exam was okay. it consists of similar questions that i practise in class and some suggested end\xe2\x80\x93of\xe2\x80\x93chapter textbook problems. i think it is fairly easy to get a perfect mark on the midterm if i attend the class regularly and take sometime to do the suggested textbook problem. overall, i think this course is engaging even though there are some restrictions due to covid. i am glad that i took this course asone of my c\xe2\x80\x93level chemistry courses.overall, it is great. not only the course material, but also some research projects help me to learn bio\xe2\x80\x93organic.labs were very educational and content of the course was easy to follow.the instructor gave examples in class that helped me further understand the materials.no

lecture withus pretty good8 please comment assistance available support learn course comment","b""goodvery responsible professors, very useful online experiment applications, very delicate ppt made.the first instructor was okay. while he started out teaching well, you could tell that later, his teachings got simple and boring. notonly were concepts not explained very well, but he even said on a couple of occasions that he himself had to google the solution orhe didn't know what to do. not really great for confidence. when explaining how to solve problems, he would provided a basicexplanation but wouldn't really explain what he was doing. the second instructor provides clear lecture slides, practice problems with clear solutions, and generally explains topic very verywell. she speaks clearly, easily, and provides lots of examples and problems with easy to follow solutions. the ta's also did a nice job explaining topics and how to solve problems.the course is vastly good, i thank prof voszy for the bonus question that gave us a chance to boost our midterm grade. for thesecond half, the prof inbeded question within the lectures further enhances understanding of the material.the lectures in the second half were rather hard to follow and understand at times, especially in the topic of chemical kinetics.the professors and the lab coordinator were very helpful with any concerns and questions.throughout the semester, it was evident that all the professors deeply cared about their students and wanted to ensure thesuccess of each and every individual. professor voznyy implemented pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures as well as live q&a sessions, where hewould go over most of the lecture material again while opening the floor for questions. this allowed students to really understandeach concept as it would be repeated in different formats multiple times. professor sullan also used the same format, except anupper year student lead the q&a session. in my opinion it would have been a little more helpful if she had followed the same formatas the previous professor and attended the live sessions herself, but nonetheless the lectures themselves gave ample opportunityfor students to learn the material and see how calculation problems would be done. lastly professor nirusha made the labs veryeasy to follow and engaging, despite the barriers of online learning.first half was a bit harder to understand, but prof was honestly great. i found that the lab portion this semester was really fair! itreally improved my understanding of the concept and it was good for the whole online situation.noi thought that dr. vozny really put a lot of effort and time into his module. he would offer so much supports in order for us to learnbetter. he would do many practice problems that are actually very applicable to questions asked in homework or exams. he hadrecorded lectures and had live lectures to go over tricky problems. i can definitely tell he cared about his students learning conceptsand it showed in his teaching efforts.dr. thavarajah was good, she included labsters to the labs this term which was much better than just giving the results for the laband doing the notebook. this way students can actually see what equipment and techniques are used in the lab.dr. sullan is not bad. has recorded lectures and the ta timbila does live lectures, he is pretty good as well.greatthe professor did not explain the concept well in my opinion. especially with voznyy, i felt like he was not explaining the conceptsand his practice questions that he was solving.the labs were enjoyable. the lecture content was more or less what anyone would expect from intro chemistry.compared to last semester, this semester was so much better. everything was so well put together and organized. the workloadwas much more fair and easier to deal with as well.this course was interesting to learn about. each teacher had a different method of teaching and that made things mostly easy tounderstand and follow.goodit was okay. there were a lot of opportunities to get marks which were good but there were a lot of problems with the lab. thereshould have been more time to do the labsters and we shouldn't have had to do the notebooks. the powerpoints have sufficientinformation .i would like to highlight professor voznyy's effort in making this online course as interactive and as smooth as possible. he hasgone beyond what is expected (eg. adding interactive live lecture sessions, providing access to clutchprep, recording extra problemsets and solutions, making test stats transparent, writing fair tests, making his expectations clear)and has really listened to ourconcerns to make improvement/adjustment in his teaching style. a very humble person with a great passion to teach! while iunderstand each professor may have a different teaching style, i believe our experience of virtual learning and the quality of thiscourse (and other online courses) would greatly improve if every faculty member has put in this much dedication and effort indelivering education.the instructors were really good at explaining the concepts. however, the format of the first half of the course included toom manydifferent videos to watch for one lecture and i found that inconvenient (in terms of time). i really like that we have practise questionsbecause it makes it easier to do the mastering homework questions.yepintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/12/2021 4/15commentsoverall, this course was very straightforward from the beginning. prof. voznyy was very clear with his expectations and what shouldbe done to study. however, his in\xe2\x80\x93class questions were a lot easier than what was on the exam which threw me off a bit, but hisreview slides at the end helped a great deal. prof. sullan explains things well. the mastering chemistry questions providedsometimes require out\xe2\x80\x93of\xe2\x80\x93the\xe2\x80\x93box thinking, but it helps to understand the concepts. she also accommodated when masteringchemistry was not working properly which is amazing.the instruction was alright. sometimes the accent made things difficult to understand, but it turned out to be fine after getting usedto it.overall, the teaching team was great. both professor voznyy and sullan have given us enough care in this course.the lecture slides are point form, which is not clear at all what the topic is talking about. the instruction and elaboration on topicwere poor.professors voznyy and sullan are able to explain concepts clearly in lecture while giving useful pointers on avoiding commonmistakes when solving problems. i especially like how professor sullan makes occasional remarks that tie the theory we learn inclass to real\xe2\x80\x93life examples. more professors should give concrete examples of the theory they are teaching.furthermore, the lectures were of appropriate length and had a decent balance between theory and example.both modules were taught amazingly well, i can really tell that the professors care about what they are talking about and genuinelywant us to do well. i was worried that it would feel disconnected due to this being a first year course with so many students, but inever felt like my professors didn't care. especially professor voznyy, he cared a lot about our success, and it made me want tosucceed even more.greatoverall is great.nice instructors, great slidesall the instructors were amazing! they were all extremely dedicated to ensuring that all the students understood the material well.the instruction was clear and concise.professor alex voznyy did a great job. he was one of the best instructors that i have ever had. he was very responsible and caring.he always responded to emails in less than 24 hours and showed so much interest.however, i did not like the second half of the semester. professor ruby teaches really fast and she does not respond to emails. ionce had a problem with my mastering chemistry and she completely ignored my email. same thing happened to one of myfriends.professor voznyy is a gem! he was literally the best possible person to teach this course and especially more so during thepandemic.the lectures were interesting and it was good that there were prerecorded ones and live components.the first part is significantly easier than the second one. however, we spent similiar time in both parts. in the first part, a recordingends in less than 40 mins a lot and we still feel free about that\xcd\xbe but the second half, the recording usually take the full hour and westill feel kind of overwhelmed.prof voznyy, was caring, passionate and thought in a way where everybody can understand the conceptsprof sullan, also caring but concepts are sometimes hard to understand from hermeetings before given lab assignment, allowing for us to prepare beforehand on what to expect. instructions provided onassignment descriptions and rubrics were also clear and easy to followprofessor voznyy truly helped to ensure we understood the course material well.i like the way lecture slides are organized to help students focus on important concepts.the course was presented quite well. i enjoyed the number of practice questions within the lectures as they were very goodapplications of the lecture content and were great indicators on whether i needed further review of a particular topic.the overall quality of the instruction in this course is really nice. professors alex voznyy and ruby sullan are very knowledgeableand are great lecturers. although they have different styles of teaching, they both incorporate many practice questions in theirlectures and other practice questions \xe2\x80\x93outside of lecture\xe2\x80\x93 to ensure we get the maximum amount of practice needed for thiscourse. to add, professor voznyy relates well with his students and is very understanding.professor vonzyy was very helpful outside of his office hours, and we could reach him at any time with questions and he wouldanswer in a short amount of time. professor sullivan's lectures were very helpful in that there was a review at the beginning of thelecture. i wished that mastering was assigned after all the materials for a chapter was learned for the second half of the course andthat the questions in mastering, i feel, was much more difficult than the questions shown during lectures for the second half of thetermthis course provided everything having to do with assignments on time and was good in allowing us to finish these assignments.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/12/2021 5/15commentsthe quality of instruction is exceptional in this course, especially through the recorded lectures. i have been able to freely take notes,watch lectures, read lectures and complete mastering chemistry assignments with the resources available to me.i found some instructions in this course a bit complex, but it may just be because i struggle in chemistry as it is. overall though,instructions were well\xe2\x80\x93delivered.professor voznyy is to date one of the best professors i have encountered. he tailored the course to the conveniences of thestudents. professor sullan is also a good lecturer in her own right and i really like all the practice problems she does in lecture withus.pretty good8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this

generally seemedlike they wanted to help us when we asked for it.mastering is awful at teaching us questions. the ""hints"" features is a nice touch that gives us a step by step guild but often mostquestion do not have this feature and in my case, stuck at the question and have to guess the answer. it also often have no orsimplify explaination that we can not learn our mistake from.the ta

pre\xe2\x80\x93recordedlectures and live q&a sessions alongside the sample problems that would be posted at the end of each chapter. additionally thelabs built on the material learned in lectures

such as clutchprep and more mastering practice problems. these wereextremely helpful in revision. he also stayed up till very late at night to answer all our questions about the content on discord whenhe did not have to. dr. thavarajah has provided many makeup lab assignments to ensure we do well in our lab and relieve some ofthat pressure. although dr. sullan\'s lectures are asynchronous, my correspondence with her over e\xe2\x80\x93mail about the content hasbeen nothing short of great\xcd\xbe she is super willing to help and tries her best to answer all my concerns.the office hours with

nirusha thavarajah please comment assistance available support learn course comments","b'goodthe content of this course and the quality of its delivery was pertinent to my understanding of the subject matter, and how i will applyit to my future career in biological research.not badgoodi found the level of support in this course to be very excellent, as we had the opportunity to attend office hours, facilitated studygroups, and tutorials.professor voznyy provided an engaging atmosphere. you can tell he went above and beyond for his students by providing bothrecorded lectures and live lectures to further explain concepts that were difficult for students. professor sullan is a bit difficult tounderstand, the second part of the course is very difficult so students need a lot of help in understanding concepts.prof voznyy, you are the best.it\'s fair.it was okay, but sometimes instructions would be confusingthe quality of teaching of this course was quite good. for the first half of the course, professor voznyy\'s lectures were well paced.he didn\'t speak too fast and still managed to explain concepts thoroughly in a shortened time. i appreciated the time reductionbecause this made it easier to focus on what was important rather than getting lost in repetitive explanations. extra quality pointscome for having a webcam on during videos. this limited the ""disembodied voice"" learning experience. professor sullan alsotaught with great detail. she had her webcam on for many of the lectures, but not all of them. my main critique is how long theselectures were but how i still felt uncertain by the end. i understood the concepts, i think, but we did a lot of practice problems in thelectures where if it was a trickier problem we would skip critical steps. i feel it would have been better to spend less time on theeasier problems and really focus on fully explaining the ones where we skipped to the answer. it was still quality material, it justbecame hard to feel motivated to watch longer lectures this far into the covid year. i enjoyed the labs this semester for theirinclusion of labster. however, on that note, the labsters were tricky to write lab reports up on, especially as much of the procedurehad to do with varying tasks that did not always have an end goal (most of my lab ""purposes"" sounded similar in saying ""to betterunderstand [broad topic]""). again, these were good tools, i would have just liked to see more quantifiable goals.i was really impressed by the shift in quality from last semester to this semester. professors were frequently seeking and applyingfeedback to improve the course, and that meant a lot. great work.goodi love how prof. ruby is great at teaching! however, she is a bit non\xe2\x80\x93lenient compared to prof. voznyy in terms of assignments. but overall, i had a great time.n/ai think that the instruction is pretty good. i really like it when there are plenty of practice questions (which there are). i also appreciatethe requirement for us to write a weekly summary that is due the same week of the lectures.overall, this course was alright\xcd\xbe lectures had some technical difficulties (both during the ""live"" portion and the prerecorded portion).while both instructors taught well, the expectation that students attend both the live lecture and watch the prerecorded lectureseemed unreasonable. this is double the amount of time a student would usually be expected to attend class and is ratherstressful.however, profs voznyy and sullan were both excellent at explaining concepts and provided many examples of what we could beassessed on during the exam.i really enjoyed professor voznyy\'s format of teaching with the recorded lectures and live bb collaborate where we can ask and goover questions. the chapter problems where he demonstrates how to solve some hard questions were very helpful in solidifyingmy understanding. the questions embedded in the lectures with professor sullen were very helpful. the change in format with thelabs from chma10 was greatly appreciated and reduced stress. the labs were also easier to understand in chma11 along with theaid of labster. mastering chemistry was not very helpful because it does not explain how to do a question if you answer it wrong.the overall quality is high. i gained much knowledge about chemistry.very goodinstruction was overall fairly good \xe2\x80\x93 pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures explained concepts well enough and there were plenty of opportunities toattend office hours/tutorials where you could ask questions. organization was fine, though there were a few mishaps here andthere (ex. changing the lecture times near the start of the course, and hitting the maximum user limit in bbcollaborate again).slides used in the lectures were posted which was quite helpful.the first half of the course (prof. voznyy) was difficult because the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures skipped over the example problems andthese were only covered in the live online sessions, which i was unable to attend. further, i do not think the organization of courseintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-4/12/2021 4/15commentsmaterial was well thought\xe2\x80\x93out because the lab that immediately followed the midterm was designed to teach the primary conceptassessed on the midterm. i did relatively poorly (for my personal standards) on the midterm and did not feel good about myknowledge of the content going into the midterm due to the fact that example questions were not gone over during the accessiblelectures. i finally understood the material during the lab, which taught the material through a labster simulation, but at that point itwas too late because the lab on that topic followed the midterm when it should have come before the midterm assessment.the overall quality of the instruction in this course was excellent! i also enjoyed doing the labster simulations for the labs, as i feltthese virtual lab simulations provided a deeper understanding to solidify the concepts learned in the lecture content!all the instructors in this course were very helpful and explained concepts clearly. their enthusiasm for the course content madethis class especially engaging. professors voznyy and sullan took a methodical approach to build problem\xe2\x80\x93solving skills in class,while professor thavarajah\'s lab notes and instructions for the virtual labs were very easy to follow.it was goodliked the professors\' approach to explain concepts, helped in the understanding of them. the practice problems discussed in bothprof. voznyy\'s and prof. sullan\'s lectures helped tremendously.out of all the sciences, i tend to enjoy chemistry the most and this course was a great testament to that. i really enjoyed theassignments and labs conducted in the duration of the course and genuinely believed that they improved my understanding ofconcepts. the professors were great and were thorough to ensure clarity of all the concepts (particularly the difficult ones) whichwas always appreciated. so overall, the course was enjoyable and a great learning experience.for the first half of the course with professor voznyy i felt that the instruction was not that clear. the lectures were not explaining theconcepts very well, so i had to rely on the textbook for the first half of the course. some of the lectures from professor voznyy werequite short even though it did not fully explain the concepts. for the second half of the course, i have really enjoyed professorsullan\'s lecture. they are a bit longer than professor voznyy\'s but she ensures that the concepts can be understood. i have not hadto rely on the textbook with this professor as i feel that i have a great understanding of the material just from watching the lectures.she includes many useful practice problems and really puts emphasis on the important topics we need to focus on. i really like howprofessor sullan repeats concepts in lectures as it helps me to grasp the topic.they were very nice and clear on what they wanted.it\'s okay.professor voznyy was ok in terms of his slides and explanations, but when he teaches he gets right to the point. he is verygenerous and considerate in his marking, and answers all questions. he is accessible, responds quickly and genuinely caresabout his students. professor sullan\'s slides are excellent and her explanations are good.it is a tough course but the professors really showed that they cared about our learning. i would say that the second half of thesemester is a bit better organized than the first. its very convenient to have a lecture and go over practice questions all in one.rather than attend both the live and recorded lecture.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec02-nirusha thavarajah-4/12/2021 5/158. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this

question for the midterm to make sure students knew what to do and to make sure they didwell.timbilla, was a great ta.his explanation was very clear, and i learned a lot from himfsgs and online tutorials were there for learning support.there were office hours, discussion boards, and announcements. one thing that particularly impressed me was theimplementation of live lectures. after watching the recorded lecture, there were live sessions that went over problems and acted asa sort of office hour for everyone. this was beneficial for students who could not attend office hours or for those who did not knowwhat to ask or even if they had questions. they were really more useful for when lectures covered concepts and live sessionsfocused on problems though. shorter lectures mean more motivation to attend live sessions, otherwise it just becomes anothersessile session sitting beside screens.goodi enjoy all the available assistance! truly motivating.tutorials, practicals, practice questions and fsgthe tutorial was really helpful in understanding the schedules and lab questions.there is assistance available though pra sessions, emails and discussion boards. some of the discussion boards were notchecked regularly, however, the emails are faster and compensates.i appreciate that both professors had clear office hours and methods of contacting them available for

her. the lab report and lab notebookrequirements are vague. the lab materials are mostly from previous years, and lots of material or information are missing. there isa labster essay which also does not have a clear description on the requirement and purpose. it is very tiresome to write a formallab report for every experiment, and it is not very meaningful to write a comprehensive lab notebook every week for the virtual labs. for the lecture instructor, the overall quality of instruction is not satisfying. there are too much mumbling and filler words, makingthe lecture somewhat hard to understand. the lecturing skills of the instructor sometimes make me hard to understand thematerial. the instructor introduces lots of experiments/researches related to the lecture material, but i think those are too much.those hard researches/experiments are distracting, and sometimes the instructor does not explain them very well, making themburdensome and boring. the lecture is also quite boring as the instructor just routinely runs through slides. the slides andmaterials are organized, but i hope the instructor can make the connections between different parts more clearly. although overall ican understand the lecture, there can be less confusions if the lecturing skills are improved. the instructor does provide somepractice questions. i hope the instructor can incorporate some questions into the lecture and explain them, so students canunderstand the material more clearly and know how to utilize the learned material. although i feel the lecture quality is improvingthroughout the semester, sometimes i still feel listening to lecture is not much different from self\xe2\x80\x93studying. i certainly know that athird year organic chemistry is not easy, but the learning can be more efficient if the lecture is more clear, organized, and interesting.decentthe professor could have made lectures more engaging or stimulating even inn an online environment.this course is quite a demanding course as the concepts and theories taught are fairly complex and the sheer amount ofassignments and lab reports take quite a bit of time to complete. at times it felt that the assignments did not really help improve myunderstanding of the material taught in the lecture nor did i feel i was getting strong constructive feedback as to how to improve myscientific writing capabilities. i would suggest that rather than having students write multiple reports that are due every week, it maybe more beneficial to assign fewer lab reports but really provide sessions where students can learn how to properly find researcharticles and write effective lab reports, highlighting quality over quantity.\xe2\x80\x93lectures were well paced\xe2\x80\x93fair

comment","b""i really appreciated the online synchronous lectures from both the profs as it was align with my learning style and felt supportiveduring the course. i also like that the lectures were recorded as well. overall, i appreciated the plentiful practice questions providedbut especially when the profs went over them with students together.i like the practice problems provided as they help better my understanding of the topics learned. i often found myself confused inlectures, but practice problems, clutch and textbook supported my learning.n/athe content was taught well.\xe2\x80\x93i love the whole presentation of the course. the professors really explained concepts in detail. it increased my love for chemistry.the course was nicely designed and i enjoyed most with prof. alex as his teaching style matched with my learning environment themost.instructors provided many helps.overall, the structure of this course was formatted in a way that makes it easy to find the things i needed. the concepts werechallenging in some chapters but with the help of clutch prep and going through some question problems in lectures somewhathelped my understanding. i still have some difficulties going through certain concepts but reading the textbook and looking atvideos from youtube helped clarify some concepts.i found the course to be not engaging. the lectures were hard to follow and the tests did not help me portray my understanding ofthe content well. tests were multiple choice and did not allow me to show my work, unlike the two lab assignments that we did(which i loved!). i know that this is partly due to the course being so complex and difficult to teach along with the hassle of onlineteaching. the lab component on the other hand was phenomenal. the lab boot camp was very informative and the two consecutivelabs were engaging and helped my laboratory techniques. if the rest of the course was structured in a way where i could actuallyshow the grading ta's my train of thought, or work that i did to get my final answers, i believe it would have helped me portray myknowledge and understanding. not being able to go back and double check my work at the end of my midterms also caused manyunnecessary mistakes that affected my grade.all instructors (lecture or lab) provided engaging material.professor ruby was great. she taught so much better than the professor for the first half. he did not explain the concepts well andwould just narrate the slides. i am so glad the professor's changed mid\xe2\x80\x93semester.i found the second half of the course, taught by professor sullan, to be insightful, helpful and engaging. her live lectures explainedthe concepts well, and i really liked that she provided her own practice questions after key points and also solved them (with fullsolutions) during the lecture. this made me enjoy her lectures a lot more because i found this to be a good use of the time, unlikefor prof. voznyy's section, where i felt unmotivated to watch the lectures because they were very monotone and did not explain theconcepts clearly, and the practice videos by prof. voznyy were also difficult to sit through because they were so long and because ofhow he often solved the questions incompletely or without a clear path for some questions (the practice videos only confused memore). for prof. voznyy's section, i had to do double the work by watching the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded videos, then attending live lectures, andthen watching the practice problem videos (which covered a whole chapter in one video, so it was very easy to get lost compared toprof. sullan's videos that gave questions by topics as they appeared), all to end up not even understanding the material. as a result,even though prof. voznyy's section of the final covers more chapters, i feel a bit more comfortable with prof. sullan's section sinceshe better explained the content, made much better use of the weekly lecture times, and provided more relevant practice questionsin her lectures. i also found it very odd that we had to pay for clutchprep for chma10 and chma11(essentially, we were paying to beable to access and complete homework that was outside of the textbook, so we had to pay for both the textbook and thehomework), as i thought that this would be covered in tuition. i heard from past utsc students that prior to the pandemic,homework was not on subscription sites like this and students did not have to pay for homework, as it was covered in the coursecosts in the tuition.a great deal of the content that is on the tests of this course is not included in the lectures. there seems to be very littlecommunication between the professors and clutch prep, which is one of the only ways to study. even the textbook is very sub parand is frustrating to use. i found myself frustrated with the quality of assistance and review material in this course. incrediblydisappointing for such an important and interesting course. this course unnecessarily piles on work when being clear andstraightforward would be easier and result in a better quality of life for students, tas and professors alike.prof voznyy taught well and explained concepts well. only his problem solving videos were a little confusing. prof sullan explainedconcepts well and went through many practice problems which helped a lot.professor thavarajah and voznyy provided interesting ways of learning and helped students with their learning. they delivered thecourse material in a satisfactory way. professor sullan however did not meet these expectations. her lectures were bland,uninteresting and did not engage in students. all this cumulates to a poor learning experience.overall quality: very goodi would say professor ruby's half of the semester went more organized in terms of lectures. moreover, she explains her topics veryintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/8/2022 4/17commentswell. on the other hand, professor voznyy's half was somehow unorganized due to many lectures (pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded and live sessions)held over the week. also, i should say i had a hard time understanding some concepts taught by professor voznyy. overall, i thinkthis duo (both professors) match very well for the course, in general, as students had experienced both easy and difficult exams.they elaborate on things you don't understand and work with the class on problem solving which i think many students struggle.this is a course with difficult content. it seemed like the instructors were aware of this and made an extra effort to help the studentsunderstand the content, but i don't think the teaching was as clear and easy to understand as a student as the instructors may havethought. the problem\xe2\x80\x93solving in lectures was the most helpful part of the instruction, i think.the course materials were challenging\xe2\x80\x93 however they were still able to be solved through office hours and practice problems.the overall quality of the instructions helped my understanding of the topic and helped me get rid of misconceptions that i hadwithin the courses. the material made me great since i have used some teachings in my daily living.i would say that the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good. it went thru many potential problems that would beon the tests. additionally, i like the assignment as it gives me some time to absorb in the information as well as steps to tackle saidproblemconcepts were taught in a way that would be understandable.i honestly felt stressed out taking this course. things piled up more quickly than i expected and even when i caught up i still feltoverwhelmed by the workload we were getting. i hope that the course could have gone at a slightly slower pace. all the processorswere nice though and i appreciate them educating me.the professors helped the students understand the concepts, along with the tas.online sucks but that's inevitable, the labs are sort of cheesy but again inevitable in a first year course with like 1000 studentsgoodexcellent.the professors tried to make online learning as effective as it possible could, and i think they succeeded in doing that. the onlinediscussions were helpful for answering questions, and the professors were willing to clarify concepts when asked. in\xe2\x80\x93personlectures would have been more interactive, however the online meetings were still interactive.profs were able to explain the material well and at a reasonable speed.ruby's module was amazingthe instruction in this course provided me with adequate material to complete assignments and enhance my knowledge inchemistry.overall the professors were engaging and broke the topics down in ways that were easier to understandlectures were not stimulatingwas good! the prof had an accent but he let us turn on the subtitles to better understand him. except sometimes his video audiowas very bad making it harder to learn the lesson.both professors are very dedicated to their students, and show it in different ways. professor sullan is great at explaining conceptsand ideas in the lecture, while professor voznyy goes above and beyond by always being available to students for questionsthrough discord, and you can really tell he wants students to succeed.professor voznyy and professor sullan did a great job at explaining concepts and providing practice questions that would be similarto ones on exams. they made sure to break down topics so that students would clearly understand the underlying theory behindthe equations.it was slightly unclear and rushed at some parts. the pacing was poor in topics that were difficult.the lectures had a good balance of content and practice problems which helped me understand how the concepts can be used tosolve problems for the term tests and exam.our first professor gave fair and understandable tests where we as a class could our skills equally but his teaching was verypoor. meanwhile our teacher for the second half was decent at explaining things compared to the other teacher but her tests werenot created equally and most students had to rely on luck to get questions where you could apply your knowledge. its very unfairconsidering not all students get the exact same question where some get easier ones than others. her layout for tests and examsare ridiculous. all you need is luck to pass her course, not skill.instruction was delivered clearly and effectively. i wish more practice was available for tests and examsthe overall quality of the instruction in this course was fair. professor voznyy had pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures and then live lectures wherehe explained important concepts from the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lecture slides. he was really good at explaining concepts and was veryhelpful. one thing that could be improved on is having the scheduled 3 lectures per week instead of 6\xe2\x80\x938 lectures per week becausei found it difficult to keep up and challenging to understand material and have time to do practice problems. i appreciated thediscord group chat with the professor so that he could answer any questions we had which was much faster than sending anemail. professor ruby sullan explained concepts really well and stuck to the 3 lectures per week which i appreciated. her slidesintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/8/2022 5/17commentsincluded only important information and she assigned us textbook questions to practice. it would be nice if professor sullan couldjoin the discord group as well so that we could ask a question we had to both professors rather than sending them separatemessages. this would facilitate communication. i also enjoyed the clutchprep homework assignments which forced to mepractice, since i find it difficult to find the time to practice on my own. all in all, the structure of this course is good and i like that thereare two midterms which puts less stress on students and allows them to do better as a result.overall, the quality of the course was well. all the professors are amazing and know what they're talking about. the lectures withprofessor vozny were at a slow pace, which helps many students, including me. i liked how he would post the lectures the nightbefore and dedicate the lecture time for questions and problem solving. the only downside was that when he was problem solving,he doesn't get to the final answer in the end. he just tells you all the formulas and steps, but not the correct answer unless you askhim. professor ruby was a lot more rushed in her lectures. she talks extremely fast and always starts exactly at 12pm. this wasextremely rough because even when i wasn't on campus and at home, i could never make it to the zoom on time to catch thebeginning of the lecture. this often makes it hard to understand the rest of the lecture, or i miss out on important information. thelab instructions are slightly vague and this would sometimes make it hard to complete the assignments or pre\xe2\x80\x93lab quizzes.the videos with the extra lecture time were helpful, but overwhelming there was too much information between both videos per dayi found the lectures were great to understand the content but i struggled with writing notes and applying the content to questions.the course instruction, although online, was excellent since live synchronous sessions were available to participate in.although the content of this course was tricky, the instructors did a sufficient job of thoroughly explaining concepts to the class.sometimes, i felt that the questions on the exams were too advanced to simply show our understanding, which was a littleunmotivating, but i still found the overall content, homework, labs, etc very fair. overall, all instructors in this course delivered contentin a fair and supportive manner.the quality of instruction in this course was very good. the professors allowed students to ask questions when they were confusedand prepared question sets for us to answer and enhance our understanding of the content.the course had a lot of information and practice problems to do that was excellent for learning.8. please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course.comments""","b""i liked that the profs were available during the synchronous lectures to not only deliver a lecture, but to respond to students\xe2\x80\x99squestions in the chat. it made the lectures feel more inclusive even with a large class size. i also liked how a prof used discord tocommunicate with students at any time and ask questions that are quickly answered.ta\xe2\x80\x99s we\xe2\x80\x99re helpful and provided good feedback to improve my work. they clearly explained concepts for practicals and answeredquestions well.my ta was extremely helpful and never hesitated to answer any of my questions. they were easily approachable and friendly.some youtube videos.\xe2\x80\x93practice questions and mock exams were provided. sample questions with solutions were also given. we had diverse questionsas examples in class that made me think critically.prof. alex was very genuine in providing the make mid\xe2\x80\x93term requests. i requested the other time for the test and he promptly repliedwith a confirm message as i had my chem lab at the same time.there were tas, questions reviewing sections, fsg.with the help of clutch prep, reading through the textbook and emailing my ta has assisted to support my learning in this course.i was unable to join many of the fsg's or office hours due to conflicting times but i was able to join a few chem aid sessions.i appreciated the ability to communicate quickly with prof. voznyy through the utsc chemistry discord channel. my ta was veryhelpful in practicals and responded quickly to emails.the assistance provided by my chem aid was pretty good. it was helpful and a good place to revisit topics you had forgotten aboutcuz of online lectures.i found that support was adequately available, as prof. voznyy replied to questions and provided updates in the discord professor'schannel (and chem students were helpful in the other discord channels), and because prof. sullan throughly replied to emails andanswered questions whenever possible during her lectures. i especially liked that prof. sullan answered content questions (eg.asked by the class) and her own practice problems in her live lectures, compared to prof. voznyy, whose live lectures did not helpmuch at all.nai didn't use any assistance.introductory chemistry ii chma11h3-s-lec01-nirusha thavarajah-4/8/2022 6/17commentsthe ta\xe2\x80\x99s were difficult to contact and rarely responded to any questions or concerns about the labs or assignments. the professorsdid make contact with any questions throughout the semester.problem\xe2\x80\x93solving sessions offered by professor voznyy helped me so much in preparing for the term tests. such sessions providedsample problems similar to what to expect in a term test, with him answering the questions. moreover, chemaid sessions offeredby ta stephen ho were helpful especially when he solved past final exam questions.email was the main communication i had with my tas and that was okay since they do try their best to reply as soon as they can.though office hours is available for further understanding for problem solving questions. discord is really helpful when we wantinstant reply from professor voznyy about anything related to his side of the lectures, clutch prep, or clarifications on exams.assignments for lab is emailing the tas.the instructors were willing to answer questions from students in lectures, which was very helpful to my learning\xcd\xbe i think it alsohelped the instructors perceive how much the students understood, in real time. as well, i think it's valuable that there are alsochemaid sessions and facilitated study groups available for students to solidify course concepts.practice problems provided by the professors, especially professor ruby sullen, were really helpful.the assistance from the fsg, lectures and office hours helped me out to a tea since they provided me with a guide on the thingsthat i was struggling in and the concepts i couldn't have gotten without their assistance.i did not use any assistance that was available to support my learning in the coursedr. voznyy was very accessible and provided extra support to those that needed it. dr. sullan was available during office hours, butwas not available at other times.there was a sufficient amount of instructions in each assignment that helped me understand it.voznyy is a gem and is super helpfulgoodamazing.professor alex was available on discord to answer questions in real time, and he also attended meetings every 2 days to answerany questions we may have had regarding the lecture content. professor ruby was very helpful during the live sessions, and answered any questions we may have had. she was also availablefor office hours by appointment.the fsg's and prof office hoursfsgprof. voznyy was available in the utsc chemistry discord server, which made it very convenient to ask questions about coursecontent or assignments.i did not access any supplementary resources.overall the professors provided me with a lot of support to do well on the exams with their practice questions and office hours andreview lectures .tas did a horrible job helping with the coursethere was a decent amount of assistance. i relyed mostly on the fsg.professor voznyy is active in the chemistry discord and always available for questions. truly appreciative for him and the time heputs inboth professor voznyy and professor sullan were easily reachable and were very open to communication with students. they madesure to answer questions as soon as possible and did their best to accommodate everyone.ta's could be asked during lab hours or emailed, and professors could be emailed though chances of response werequestionable.the assistance that was available for this course was good. there were chemistry fsg's and chem\xe2\x80\x93aid sessions for students toattend as well as office hours. there was also a discord created where we could ask professor voznyy questions.deadlines were adequately changed and modifiedi liked clutchprep, although it was inconvenient that the questions were unavailable to study from before the test.although i did not require any assistance myself, it was made clear that assistance was available to students.prof. vozny was always available for immediate responses regarding the course. this was a huge relief for us, students.additionally, adequate support was provided during tutorial times and during lectures.there were fsgs, office hours and the clutch prep platform used to test us on course content.the course had a lot of support and the professors, ta's, and lab coordinators were very helpful and always willing to help. i feltvery welcomed and appreciated as a student.""","b "" i really appreciated the online synchronous lectures from both the profs as it was align with my learning style and felt supportiveduring the course . i also like that the lectures were recorded as xwell . overall , i appreciated the plentiful practice questions providedbut especially when the profs went over them with students together . i like the practice problems provided as they help better my understanding of the topics learned . i often found myself confused inlectures , but practice problems , clutch and textbook supported my learning . n/athe content was taught well . \xe2\x80\x93i love the whole presentation of the course . the professors really explained concepts in detail . it increased my love for chemistry . the course was nicely designed and i enjoyed most with prof . alex as his teaching style matched with my learning environment themost . instructors provided many helps . overall , the structure of this course was formatted in a way that makes it easy to find the things i needed . the concepts werechallenging in some chapters but with the help of clutch prep and going through some question problems in lectures somewhathelped my understanding . i still have some difficulties going through certain concepts but reading the textbook and looking atvideos from youtube helped clarify some concepts . i found the course to be not engaging . the lectures were hard to follow and the tests did not help me portray my understanding ofthe content well . tests were multiple choice and did not allow me to show my work , unlike the two lab assignments that we did ( which i loved ! ) . i know that this is partly due to the course being so complex and difficult to teach along with the hassle of onlineteaching . the lab component on the other hand was phenomenal . the lab boot camp was very informative and the two consecutivelabs were engaging and helped my laboratory techniques . if the rest of the course was structured in a way where i could actuallyshow the grading ta ' s my train of thought , or work that i did to get my final answers , i believe it would have helped me portray myknowledge and understanding . not able to xgo back and double check my work at the end of my midterms also caused manyunnecessary mistakes that affected my grade . all instructors ( lecture or lab ) provided engaging material . professor ruby was great . she taught so much better than the professor for the first half . he did not explain the concepts well andwould just narrate the slides . i am so glad the professor ' s changed mid\xe2\x80\x93semester . i found the second half of the course , taught by professor sullan , to be insightful , helpful and engaging . her live lectures explainedthe concepts xwell and i really liked that she provided her own practice questions after key points and also solved them ( with fullsolutions ) during the lecture . this made me enjoy her lectures a lot more because i found this to be a good use of the time , unlikefor prof . voznyy ' s section , where i felt unmotivated to watch the lectures because they were very monotone and did not explain theconcepts clearly , and the practice videos by prof . voznyy were also difficult to sit through because they were so long and because ofhow he often solved the questions incompletely or (without) not clear path for some questions ( the practice videos only confused memore ) . for prof . voznyy ' s section , i had to do double the work by watching the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded videos , then attending live lectures , andthen watching the practice problem videos ( which covered a whole chapter in one video , so it was very easy to get lost compared toprof . sullan ' s videos that gave questions by topics as they appeared ) , all to end up not understanding the material . as a result , ven though prof . voznyy ' s section of the final covers more chapters , i feel a bit more comfortable with prof . sullan ' s section sinceshe better explained the content , made much better use of the weekly lecture times , and provided more relevant practice questionsin her lectures . i also found it very odd that we had to pay for clutchprep for chma10 and chma11 ( essentially , we were paying to beable to access and complete homework that was outside of the textbook , so we had to pay for both the textbook and thehomework ) , as i thought that this would be covered in tuition . i heard from past utsc students that prior to the pandemic , omework was not subscription sites like this and students did not pay for homework , as it was covered in the coursecosts in the tuition . a xgreat deal of the content that is on the tests of this course is not included in the lectures . there seems to be very littlecommunication between the professors and clutch prep , which is one of the only ways to study . even the textbook is very sub parand is frustrating to use . i found myself frustrated with the quality of assistance and review material in this course . incrediblydisappointing for such an important and interesting course . this course unnecessarily piles on work when being clear andstraightforward would be easier and result in a better xquality of life for students , tas and professors alike . prof voznyy taught well and explained concepts well . only his problem solve videos were a xlittle confusing . prof sullan explainedconcepts well and went through many practice problems which helped a lot . professor thavarajah and voznyy provided interesting ways of learning and helped students with their learning . they delivered thecourse material in a satisfactory way . professor sullan however did not meet these expectations . her lectures were bland , ninteresting and did not engage in students . all this cumulates to a poor learning experience . overall quality : very goodi would say professor ruby ' s half of the semester went more organized in terms of lectures . moreover , she explains her topics veryintroductory chemistry ii chma11h3 - s - lec01 - nirusha thavarajah - 4/8/2022 4/17commentswell . on the other hand , professor voznyy ' s half was somehow unorganized due to many lectures ( pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded and live sessions ) held over the week . also , i should say i had a hard time understanding some concepts taught by professor voznyy . overall , i thinkthis duo ( both professors ) match very well for the course , in general , as students had experienced both easy and difficult exams . they elaborate on things you do not understand and work with the class on problem solve which i think many students struggle . this is a course with difficult content . it seem xlike the instructors were aware of this and made an extra effort to help the studentsunderstand the content , but i do not think the teaching was as clear and easy to understand as a student as the instructors may havethought . the problem\xe2\x80\x93solving in lectures was the most helpful part of the instruction , i think . the course materials were challenging\xe2\x80\x93 however they were still able to be solved through office hours and practice problems . the overall quality of the instructions helped my understanding of the topic and helped me get rid of misconceptions that i hadwithin the courses . the material made me great since i have used some teachings in my daily living . i would say that the overall quality of the instruction in this course was very good . it went thru many potential problems that would beon the tests . additionally , i like the assignment as it gives me some time to absorb in the information as xwell as steps to tackle saidproblemconcepts were taught in a way that would be understandable . i honestly felt stressed out taking this course . things piled up more quickly than i expected and even when i caught up i still feltoverwhelmed by the workload we were getting . i hope that the course could have gone at a slightly slower pace . all the processorswere nice though and i appreciate them educating me . the professors helped the students understand the concepts , along with the tas . online sucks but that ' s inevitable , the labs are sort of cheesy but again inevitable in a first year course with like 1000 studentsgoodexcellent . the professors tried to make online learning as effective as it possible could , and i think they succeeded in doing that . the onlinediscussions were helpful for answering questions , and the professors were willing to clarify concepts when asked . in\xe2\x80\x93personlectures would have been more interactive , however the online meetings were still interactive . profs were able to explain the material well and at a reasonable speed . ruby ' s module was amazingthe instruction in this course provided me with adequate material to complete assignments and enhance my knowledge inchemistry . overall the professors were engaging and broke the topics down in ways that were easier to understandlectures were not stimulatingwas good ! the prof had an accent but he let us turn on the subtitles to better understand him . except sometimes his video audiowas very bad making it harder to learn the lesson . both professors are very dedicated to their students , and show it in different ways . professor sullan is great at explaining conceptsand ideas in the lecture , while professor voznyy goes above and beyond by always being available to students for questionsthrough discord , and you can really tell he wants students to succeed . professor voznyy and professor sullan did a great job at explaining concepts and providing practice questions that would be similarto ones on exams . they made sure to break down topics so that students would clearly understand the underlying theory behindthe equations . it was slightly unclear and rushed at some parts . the pacing was poor in topics that were difficult . the lectures had a good balance of content and practice problems which helped me understand how the concepts can be used tosolve problems for the term tests and exam . our first professor gave fair and understandable tests where we as a class could our skills equally but his teaching was verypoor . meanwhile our teacher for the second half was decent at explaining things compared to the other teacher but her tests werenot created equally and most students had to rely on luck to get questions where you could apply your knowledge . its very unfairconsidering not students get the exact same question where some get easier ones than others . her layout for tests and examsare ridiculous . all you need is luck to pass her course , not skill . instruction was delivered clearly and effectively . i wish more practice was available for tests and examsthe overall quality of the instruction in this course was fair . professor voznyy had pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures and then live lectures wherehe explained important concepts from the pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lecture slides . he was really good at explaining concepts and was veryhelpful . one thing that could be improved on is having the scheduled 3 lectures per week instead of

glad i was able to complete at least some in person labs.test marking (point distribution strategy) is not helpful, causes students additional stress.the overall quality of the instruction in the course was good because each professor explained how to solve the problems and wentover important concepts in their lectures.professor voznyy provided many opportunities to engage with and understand the material. i think professor sullan provided okayinstruction but was less thorough in explaining the practice.n/ai like that professor voznyy provided both a pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lecture and a live lecture. i also like how he made in\xe2\x80\x93depth videosexplaining various example questions from each chapter. professor sullan did a great job explaining the concepts during herlectures. especially through repetition and her small review section at the beginning of each new lecture. i also like how manypractice problems she included in her lecture and that she provided in\xe2\x80\x93depth solutions. i felt that the midterms were notunreasonable and tested our knowledge of the concepts pretty fairly.this and chma10 are the most heavy courses at this school and the most stressful. it is like being bombarded with informationand assignments and once you get held back you can never ever catch up. i do mostly blame myself for not doing as well as icould've but i wish the structure was easier to cope with.professor voznyy's part of the class was very good. he explained each step during the calculations and made a stress freeenvironment. professor ruby's part was a little hectic, her term test was very difficult and the notes were hard to understand at timesthe lectures are good, the professors go through the material and do lots of practice problems.this course was well taught and executed. i think each instructor gave plentiful of resources and support. i found the peerscholarassignment to be a nice and refreshing break from the other assignments such as clutchprep and lab assignments.teaching method of prof. vozny was ineffective (for me personally). course material was spread out through recorded lectures,synchronous lectures and office hours so it was hard to know where to look for needed information. prof. vozny appeared unpraped for multiple lectures and didn't explain material clearly.the course was heavy but very informativethe instruction was okay.both professors did a decent job in explaining concepts and going through problem calculations, which was challenging.alterations to the syllabus during the semester made the course a bit disorganized and confusing, but generally a decent course.the workload of this class is so overwhelming, and the labs are so different from what is being studied in the content at the time. itwould be more helpful if we were conducting labs that had to do with what we were currently learning. the marking schemes arefair for the most part (for labs and writing assignments), but it was a lot of work throughout the semester. additionally, the professorswere posting so many videos, especially in the first half, and it became so overwhelming that there was no time for anything else.this class should not be split up into 3 separate hours, and if it is, it should be completely synchronous to give the students achance to ask questions on the spot. additionally, we should not be rushing through concepts throughout the class just to fiteverything in.incorporating problems and showing the solutions to them made this a great course.course content was explained well, and questions from students were answered during class.professor voznyy was excellent in providing practice questions and help to students for the understanding of concepts. on themidterm professor sullen's questions were quite difficult and some did not completely correlate to what was taught, however, shewas helpful during live lectures.the instructions regarding assignments and tests are detailed.there were no assignments or any quizzes that we could have done helping us in the content of ruby's part of the course. althoughclutch existed, the problems weren't as diverse and ruby\xe2\x80\x93like as i expected them to be.i really admired my professors going through multiple practice problems as it allowed me to understand how to solve certainproblems, or problems similar to those. for future purposes, please release a document of practice problems and the answerswith steps on how to solve them.both professors were very helpful to students and did lots of practice questionsexcellentconcepts were explained relatively clearly and understandably.i liked how the lectures were synchronous, this allowed for questions to be clarified without needing to wait for an

greatly appreciated this.professor sullan was also fairly quick to reply to emails.there were so many aids and sessions to help but because of how heavy it is i couldn't find time or motivation to reach out.the ta was able to provide assistance during our tutorial time and anytime throughout the weeki think each instructor had ample of resources and support (office hours, live zoom classes).

professor alex's side with his individual lecture problem videos, however i didn't like ruby's integration of a fewproblems in her lectures as when it comes time to review, there isn't a video where you could just watch all the problems be solvedin one go.textbooks, facilitated study groups, etc.stephen ho does great tutorialsexcellentnone requested.the support was fast, concise and also very

However, becausethe professor goes through the slides pretty fast, it's hard to stay engaged and participate in class. Lastly, although theassignments were meaningful, the instructions/requirements are not always consistent across different communication channels.For example, the assignment descriptions says one thing but the grading sheet says something else, which confuses people.The lecture slides summarized and gave a good understanding of the readings. Instructions on assignments were confusing andrequire to follow up to gain a better understanding. Aspects of measuring reliability and validity were very confusing. There could beadditional instruction on reliability and validity.easy but requires a lot of unnecessary effort.

I think that byimplementing more case assignments as homework would be beneficial for students to feel engaged in what they'relearning.

She was always very friendly and always tried her best answering anyquestions that I had. Her way of teaching was great and explained all the concepts of the course very well.GreatThe quality of instruction is fine, it is a bit strange that she will often explain a concept partially, tell us to discuss in ourgroups, then interrupt to explain the next part, which means students are talking over her and we can't hear her OR eachother. I think many things are explained in WAY too much detail that is completely unnecessary knowledge for themanagement co\xe2\x80\x93op program. We already learned about concepts like the dimensions of personality in organizationalbehaviour, I don't see why we have to relearn it. There are certain topics such as salary negotiation which are taughtfrom a managerial perspective which doesn't really make sense at this stage\xe2\x80\x93 we're being taught why employeeswould negotiate certain things and how to deal with that, but we have never learned how to deal with salary negotiationfrom the employee perspective (ie. in a practical way so we can actually employ this knowledge when we go out and getour first jobs. Why am I learning how to be a manager at this stage? I can't even get an entry\xe2\x80\x93level job). Either way,(continuing with the topic of salary negotiation but this applies to other topics as well) the teaching focuses on thetheory rather than practical applications and strategies. I feel like this course focuses so much on forcing us to readacademic papers and psychological studies rather than teaching us real\xe2\x80\x93life skills, which is ultimately pointless foranyone that isn't pursuing academia. The role plays in this class kind of steer it into a more practical direction, but Idon't think it's quite there because the teaching focuses too much on theory rather than application so it doesn't reallyhelp us do the role play as well as it could.Other than the above, there are some small things I feel aren't conducive to learning. Assignments are excessivelystructured. Why should a 2.5 page paper have 5 pages of instructions on what to include? As well, why are we notallowed to screenshot graphs presented in papers to use in our presentations, but have to recreate them ourselves?Class discussion and activities were beneficial to my learning.Assignments are repetitive and graded inconsistently. Course assignments were made unnecessarily hard.Overall, the quality of the teaching is really good, esp with the role plays.\xe2\x80\x93 Awesome course, professor is willing to help you and the class enviornment is active.\xe2\x80\x93 Fittable class sizeThe types of tasks done in class were very helpful and engaging to learn about the content.8.

Using the final assignment for your own furtherresearch does not seem ethical. Telling students they must sign a form releasing their research to you should not be required\xcd\xbe it's achoice, not a must and that is why I refused to sign. I believe the overall quality of the class was poor as the prof does not seem tocare about learning and is interested in having a class of students to fill out her weekly surveys that contribute to her currentresearch.

Also, when tickets are given out at the end of class, some people get the tickets anyways without participating.Like Professor Andrew Stark, it is better to write down the name of each student when they actually speak.It was a boring course. If this is not my program requirement, I won't take this course.I think the subject is fairly easy, but the professor made it too complicated. Overflow of information actually causedconfusion regarding rather simple matter.Professor Radhakrishnan is good at her job.

The assignments are morefocused on helping you to learn how to conduct research on a topic and put up a research paper, instead of focusing onwhat we found and learn on those leadership topics.

Not really surewhat the professor is expecting.The course was interesting and stimulating from the role plays and lectures but the course didn\'t seem to be muchabout leadership skills.Very goodThe ""coupon"" element is highly distracting. Also the professor commonly preferred to pick students who she preferredanswers from. This lead to her skipping and not choosing other students and limiting their chances for coupons. Theexample was not a one time occurrence, but rather occurred multiple times throughout the course and potentially tomore than one student. This is relevant due to the disproportionate number of coupons some students have comparedto others. Also considering the class size of 40+, it is unlikely that the professor asks for 40+ questions or at least 40+opportunities to speak. The result is that not everyone has an equal possibility to earn coupons, especially when theprofessor plays favorites. This is ultimately very discouraging to students and is an inherently unfair system. It ispossible that on average there was an adequate number of coupons per student, but I believe that this figure is mostlyoffset by the larger number of coupons that a small number of students earn. Also the seemly conflicting answers that the professor talks about the roleplay and what are the slides. It is difficult toget concise and accurate answers on what to state on the final considering the fact that the final is primarily based onthem. Considering there are two different lectures, it is difficult to know which classes are more or less applicable towhat the professor wants on the final, as it is with other discussion heavy courses. It is also confusing why there issuch a heavy emphasis on psychology for a Human Resources course in management. Despite the workshops, thenature of the writings/written material are inherently different especially in the research materials aspect. But what reallyset it apart in a negative way was, the fact that the professor expected scientific processes and methods thatmanagement students are not trained in and are not usually expected fluent in seemed unfair. The strange heavy focuson psychology made it confusing as to what is expected of students and what to make of the course. It also made thecourse too dissimilar to other managements.The professor was average She tried her best, but I feel as though a lot of the course was subjective (ie. participationmarks). I\'m the type of student that doesn\'t like to participate in class, which made going to this class increase mystress levels. Truthfully, I didn\'t learn much from this course. Will most likely learn the material on my own for the finalexam.8.

The lectures were very repetitive and quite boring and unrelated to coursematerial. There was no textbook or assigned weekly readings. The professor was unclear on her expectations and howto prepare for the course. The classes were very dull and I did not learn much from the random group work we did eachlecture. I felt the course was not being taught at a university level. The assignments were confusing and I the prof wasvery unclear in her expectations. There was a huge gap in the prof's teaching and the TA's marking. The TA wasmarking our work at a much higher level and standard than what the professor was teaching and I felt the assignmentswere not connected to the course material. The course was about management skills and teaching us real life skillsthat we can use and apply in the business world. The assignments, particularly the group project had nothing to do withapplying leadership skills to real life. It was a heavily research based assignment that was already covered in theOrganizational Behaviour course (MGHB02) and I felt the group project should be changed and aligned with the course.Also the TA provided to office hours and we could not get in touch with her so there was no way for us to clarify theexpectations or talk to her about assignments to get a better understanding of the course material and her markingscheme. Instead the prof would just give us the assignment and we would base our assignment on what the prof saidbut the TA would mark totally differently and had a different set of expectations for us that we were unaware of.Phani is a great personHighly simulating and engaging class- passionate - increase my understanding about the management skillsThe role play was really great!

This professor has made minimal teachingeffort and my tuition fee for this course is a total waste. I am really frustrated that a university course could be likeworkshops.The instructor was enthusiastic about the material and overall, provided an enjoyable classroom environment. Shewas attentive to the concerns of her students and provided additional feedback on assignments if requested.However, I experienced some level of prejudice because of my program choice. I am in arts management, and thereis this stigma surrounding arts management students in management courses; that the content of our program is'artistic', 'inherently 'liberal' or based on loose concepts. We have the same understanding of all content as inmanagement courses. We need to eliminate this binary of 'artsy' versus 'business' and accept that all these studentsare interested in innovation through both non-profit and for-profit corporations. Professors - stop singling us out.Instead of teaching, the instructor gave our LOTS of opportunities to role play with the intention to let us learn whilepracticing. However, I do not think I have learned anything important or useful in the role play. I do think the debriefafter the role play is much helpful but it only lasts for 30 minutes (it is a 2-hour course).She was very helpful and approachable. A lot of dialogue between students and professor.8.

However, the instructions in class were sometimes vague and asking the professor again didnot really help clarify it, moreover some of the concepts weren't really explained clearly. I enjoy doing the journals, butsometimes if she didn't provide us with enough time in class, it can be a distraction to our learning.The overall quality of instruction in this course was poor. The lectures required us to answer questions for our journalswhich was rather stressful and did not help with learning the material. Instead of learning, we would be busy answeringquestions as the journals could be due 1 hour after class. The assignments were not representative of what HR shouldbe. The professor got us to do lots of statistics (regression analysis) and less on HR related content includingselection and recruitment, which was what I was excited to learn in this class. Overall, lectures were not veryintellectually stimulating. Also, the midterm was disappointing as there were 60 multiple choices and only 10 marks forshort answer, making it not fair.In class journal instructions were very unclear for the first classes. We later learned how to interpret what she meant.There's too much information and the textbook is hard to read. This course may do better if it focuses on main conceptsthan all the information in the textbook.Quite good, but it would be great that the questions are typed out for the journals, it\xe2\x80\x99s time consuming to type out all thequestionsThe prof tried to cover too much material in every lecture that she only ended up touching upon very few things and therest we had to self teach. She also went so fast that it was impossible to retain anything we were supposed to belearning.The professor did not teach the content well. The exams did not reflect what we learned in class. Professor skippedthrough the content really quickly in class.Professor was very knowledgeable about the subject matter. The course content moved a little bit quickly but that isacceptable in an accelerated class. A lot of in\xe2\x80\x93class work but not enough time to complete, sometimes unclearinstructions.8.

I thought this was something that should be decided beforehand.\xe2\x80\x93 Course PPT were copied from the textbook but were not rephrased. This made it harder to refer back and understand the coursecontent independently when self\xe2\x80\x93studying\xe2\x80\x93 Individual assignment was not clear/ instructions were not linearThe Professor brought a lot of interesting idea. However, we need to make appointment to see her in her scheduled office hour. It iskind of inconvenient. Hope professor provide more opportunities for us to approach her. And we have been not provided a standard answer for the midterm. Thus, we can\xe2\x80\x99t directly compare the answer and improve it.No commentThe content of the course was interesting and very useful to real world purposes. The exams were designed in a way to rewardthose who attend lectures, pay attention and put a lot of time studying. The only issue I had in the course was the criteria that theTA\'s use to mark the short answer questions on the exams. They use a very unfair and harsh marking system that doesn\'t causesstudents\' marks to not reflect their understanding of the course material.Engaging class environment, activities conducive to learning, participation was highly encouraged.The overall quality of this course was very good because she provides some interesting class activities for us in order to learn thematerials. I also like the in\xe2\x80\x93class journal that we get at the end of each class. It actually helps us understand better on the materialsmore. She creates a friendly environment in class and encouraged me to discuss to peers in the class.The instructor is excellent on every aspects of teaching. She is good at engaging students and creating an active atmosphere inclass, this quality is important for a teacher. Besides, the only improvement needed is about the short answer questions inmidterm. Almost 80% of them focus on one case that we talk in class early. It makes the test ""narrow"" but not ""comprehensive""since students who only focus on studying this case but not other chapter can get a high score.My suggestion is to allocate the weight of each chapter evenly to the short answer questions.Teaching was not textbook based, but instead are full of real\xe2\x80\x93life case studies, which provides more interactions between us. Also itmakes this boring course more interestingthe instructor was effective in providing examples as enhancement to my understanding. real life situations after every topic helpedme to develop a realistic perspective and put the topic into context instead of just a theory. each week had a journal componentreflecting on the content which I thought was helpful however it often had a deadline shortly after class which i struggled with as idid not always have access to a laptop or computer.The lectures were not very clear, I had to rely on the textbook for my learning8.

The instruction she gave was really unclear and confusing.Im going to be honest, the professor was completely useless in terms of learning the course material. She should not even bequalified to teach ANY course ever again. I understand that she is getting paid handsomely based on her academic research andbackground, but she was not able to translate that knowledge effectively in class. I will never take another course with her again.She is definitely the worst professor in terms of learning and helping the class understand the material. For example, we wereassigned a group project. We had previously skyped her multiple times asking her and confirming the information we needed topresent. During the call, she told us that the info is correct and how we should present it effectively. We literally presented what shehad told us to do and for some reason, she has the guts to tell us that our group did not provide the correct graphs and data.the overall quality of the instruction in this course is great. The instruction with detailed explanationThe course was well taught and the professor was very helpful. She helped us with any problems and the exam was fairly testedand I would take another course with this professor.Professor R did a fairly good job in explaining concepts and making the class interactive so that we would learn from the exercisesdone in class. She incorporated many activities that made it more interesting than a plain 2 hour lecture. She could be a little moreclear when explaining what is expected of us in assignments and exams though. It was difficult to understand exactly what shewanted in our assignment and it led to confusion amongst many students. Overall, she showed great enthusiasm in the courseand tried to make the class catered towards ensuring the students found the content stimulating so I appreciate that.It was okConcepts were very similar and made it unable do differentiate ideas and terms. Even after asking the professor for a betterexplanation, answers were vague. I am not the only person who thinks this. My entire section of 10 students was usually veryconfused.I felt my time was wasted for this course, I can't understand the meaning of this course and no interest in it at all. Every week's classwe have to do a journal to get a participation mark, that's a lot of work to do. Sometimes it is a group participation work, it reallysucks cuz one of my group members never did the work, she only hopes others to do it. I hate this course, it makes me stressful,especially in the final group work when you meet lazy ppl, you have to do a lot of extra work. And you still can't find the meaning ofthis course.This prof introduced several times that she graduated from Dr. at Illinois University. She played her speech video which made in2002, Idk why she always emphasis her honor to students in class. It seemed that she is addicted to glory......the instruction in this class was extremely poor. Dr. R is a fantastic person who is very kind and passionate about her field of study,although the teaching in this class was BAD. Every class the instruction for in\xe2\x80\x93class journals very unclear, every class member ofthe class would have to clear multiple times in order to figure out what was needed to be done and the objective remained unclearmost of the time. the final project was a mess, the directions were so unclear and she gave a lecture to better clarify the final projectbut it made the problem worse even more confusing. in my opinion, we learned very little during class time, class time was spentplaying games to highlight the lecture objective rather than actually going over the terms and definitions in greater depth. Dr. R has agreat depth of knowledge in her field but struggles to convey her message in an effective way.Manage People & Grps in Orgs Organizational Behaviour-F-LEC01-Phanikiran Radhakrishnan-12/2/2019 4/168.

I enjoyed her class.The instructor was poor in her teaching methods due to the following:1) Did not articulate subjects well2) Did not create a productive learning environment3) Learned more reading in the textbook than her 2 hour lecturesIt is clear she is passionate about OB and she is enthusiastic during class. Although, I feel she makes us do too manyjournal questions especially during the second class. The journal questions do not really help us understand thematerial as they are usually written before she explains the topic. It is more a precursor to the material and more forparticipation rather than learning.The assignments were useless in relation to the course material. The prof didn't teach us anything relevant to theassignments that we had to complete. Much of the course incorporated STATS material instead of qualitative info aboutorganizational behavior.I have heard and know that the Professor is an astounded researcher. This being said, I was disappointed in theinstruction of the course and felt it was below UofT standards. The professor would breeze over the lecture slides neverstopping to showcase an important concept. The marking scheme was very subjective and getting an A was withoutreach even if you followed all instructions. The professor would sometimes post homework due the night before andwould expect you to come with it to class. I would not recommend taking this course with this professor.boring, class journals are useless8.

No comment.Getting help from either the professor or TAs was quick and easy. I appreciated the quickness of responses to emails Ihad sent,Both the professor and TA provided plenty of office hours, and also made their emails available for any furtherquestions.Office hours were alright.There were no TAs, but the prof was somewhat helpful.Feedback was very vague on assignment handback. Have not received group project marks which is disappointing andalso concerning that the marks were not handed back before the course evaluations were due even though we weretold we would receive them on Monday.Manage People & Grps in Orgs Organizational Behaviour-F-LEC01-Phanikiran Radhakrishnan-12/4/20174/15   '","b "" the overall quality of the course is not good as i expected . the professor is trying to transfer the teachingresponsibilities to the students . if she can not all the chapters in one course , then she should try to select sometopics rather than just letting the student talking about it . i did not find the content of the course very interesting , useful or relevant to my knowledge as a management studentphanikiran radhakrishnan had created a learning environment which encouraged participation and interactions withother , which in turn helped us learn and understand course concepts . she also constantly gave highly relevantexamples to further our understanding of these concepts . overall , instruction of the course was very well done . good in class journals help to recap what you are learning and connect with other students . more classes shouldincorporate this . the professor explained concepts very clearly and and provided various assignments and tasks that helped provide aclear understanding of the material . i enjoyed her class . the instructor was poor in her teaching methods due to the following : 1 ) did not articulate subjects well2 ) did not create a productive learning environment3 ) learned more reading in the textbook than her 2 hour lecturesit is clear she is passionate about ob and she is enthusiastic during class . although , i feel she makes us do too xmanyjournal questions especially during the second class . the journal questions do not help us understand thematerial as they are usually written before she explains the topic . it is more a precursor to the material and more forparticipation rather than learning . the assignments were useless in relation to the course material . the prof did not teach us anything relevant to theassignments that we had to complete . much of the course incorporated stats material instead of qualitative info aboutorganizational behavior . i have heard and know that the professor is an astounded researcher . this being said , i was disappointed in theinstruction of the course and felt it was below uoft standards . the professor would breeze over the lecture slides neverstopping to showcase an important concept . the marking scheme was very subjective and getting an a was withoutreach even if you followed all instructions . the professor would sometimes post homework due the night before andwould expect you to come with it to class . i would not recommend taking this course with this professor . boring , class journals are useless8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse .

I like the course because it has a lot to explore and run. But the midtermand final exams which are worth 30% and 40% each are only 30 and 35 mark exams which makes it really difficult to assess theimportance of each questions and how much focus should be put in each questions. Also, once the exam is graded \xe2\x80\x93 studentsreceived grade like 1.723/2 which doesn't really seem like a grade but rather arbitrary numerical numbers. I think if the gradingsystem could be set differently \xe2\x80\x93 this course will be much better than what it is.Unclear instructions on most assignments/exams ... deducted marks from lack of application to the readings when we were notcommunicated to apply the readings in class or in instructions for most of the evaluations.Cases helped to give real life examples of certain negotiation situations we might encounter in the future.While the idea of teaching negotiations with hands\xe2\x80\x93on role plays is certainly the best way, it would have been helpful to providesome concepts for a structured approach earlier on, as the role plays are otherwise mostly unstructured and inefficient trial anderror. And as the cases differ too much in situations and necessary techniques one could not even learn why certain approaches toa particular problem actually work or if it was just a coincidence. E.g. it would have helped to introduce the PAST model after the firstgroup negotiation to give the students some tries in implementing it while not wasting too much time on unstructured arguments.Similarily while it was good to learn about some background concepts and techniques that play a role, it would be great to get someframeworks and as above, structured approaches that help in conducting the negotiations to avoid getting lost in trying toimplement certain strategies at certain points in real\xe2\x80\x93life negotiations. E.g. if one does not have a benchmark of how an efficient,structured negotiation can work it is easy to get lost in details and in having to react to the other party's strategies.8. Please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course.Comments""","b'Professor Radhakrishnan made herself readily available to students outside of class hours.Syllabus was locked on Quercus from the 1st day ... no formal documentation of course policies or assistance provided outside ofclass (if any). No office hours communicated.TA was helpful with feedback and professor gave thorough debriefs at the end of the caseThe slides were only of moderate use, it might help to get a uniform layout that helps to keep track of the structure of the lecture.Also, the information conveyed was limited. Additionally, I personally did not have the feeling that an understanding of the theoreticalconcepts from the lecture helped in the midterm or final exam as it was almost impossible to obtain a full mark on any givenquestion, regardless of what was answered. The final was also somewhat short in time compared to the required answers to thequestions.The readings were interesting and mostly helpful in understanding the course material.'","b "" professor radhakrishnan ' s approach to students preparing for and reflecting on negotiation role plays in a way that is coordinatedwith course concepts was one of the best models for learning that i have seen when compared to my other bba courses . i think the grading criteria for this course is not fair at all . i like the course because it has a lot to explore and run . but the midtermand final exams which are xworth   % and 40% each are only 30 and 35 mark exams which makes it really difficult to assess theimportance of each questions and how much focus should be put in each questions . also , once the exam is graded \xe2\x80\x93 studentsreceived grade like 1 . 723/2 which does not xlike a grade but rather arbitrary numerical numbers . i think if the gradingsystem could be set differently \xe2\x80\x93 this course will be much better than what it is . unclear instructions on most assignments/exams . . . deducted marks from lack xof xapplication to the readings when we were notcommunicated to apply the readings in class or in instructions for most of the evaluations . cases helped to give real life examples of certain negotiation situations we might encounter in the future . while the idea of teaching negotiations with hands\xe2\x80\x93on role plays is certainly the best way , it would have been helpful to providesome concepts for a structured approach earlier on , as the role plays are otherwise mostly unstructured and inefficient trial anderror . and as the cases differ too xmuch in situations and necessary techniques one could not learn why certain approaches toa particular problem actually work or if it was just a coincidence . eg it would have helped to introduce the past model after the firstgroup negotiation to give the students some tries in implementing it while not wasting too xmuch time on unstructured arguments . similarily while it was good to learn about some background concepts and techniques that play a role , it would be great to get someframeworks and as above , structured approaches that help in conducting the negotiations to (avoid) not lost in trying toimplement certain strategies at certain points in real\xe2\x80\x93life negotiations . eg if one does not benchmark of how an efficient , tructured negotiation can work it is easy to get lost in details and in having to react to the other party ' s strategies . 8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course . comments """,0.0642201834862385,0.100917431192661,0.110091743119266,0.0779816513761468,0.036697247706422,0.123853211009174,0.178899082568807,0.018348623853211,0.0596330275229358,0.0596330275229358,0.0963302752293578,0.0779816513761468,0.00917431192660551,0.110091743119266,0.165137614678899,0,0,0.0137614678899083,0.00458715596330275,0.0596330275229358,0.0963302752293578,0.0825688073394495,0.0779816513761468,0.00917431192660551,0.114678899082569,0.151376146788991,0,0,0.055045871559633,0.018348623853211,0,0.00458715596330275,0,0.0229357798165138,0.0275229357798165,0.00458715596330275,0.0412844036697248,0.00917431192660551,0,0.00917431192660551,0.0458715596330275,0.00917431192660551,0,0.0137614678899083,0,0,0.00458715596330275,0.00458715596330275,0.0229357798165138,0.00917431192660551,0.00917431192660551,0.00917431192660551,0.0321100917431193,0.0137614678899083,0.00458715596330275,0.018348623853211,0,0,0,0,0.00458715596330275,0.00458715596330275,0.0137614678899083,0,0.018348623853211,0.018348623853211,0.0137614678899083,0,0.110091743119266,0.0504587155963303,0.0137614678899083,0.0275229357798165,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0.055045871559633,0.018348623853211,0.0871559633027523,0.0779816513761468,0,0.0642201834862385,0.155963302752294,0,-0.0137614678899083,0.0137614678899083,0.00458715596330275,0.055045871559633,0.0917431192660551,0.0596330275229358,0.0688073394495413,0,0.105504587155963,0.119266055045872,-0.0137614678899083,-0.00458715596330275,0.036697247706422,0.018348623853211,0,0.00458715596330275,0,0.018348623853211,0.0229357798165138,0,"Negotiation Skills","LEC30",3.8,4,"4.3",3.1,"3.1",3.5,"3.8","2.9",3.8,572,81.53,16.79,49.18,58.56,40.86,26.22,87.24,4.55,1.57,1.75,1.22,18.53,0.52,17.66,4.72,1.4,1.57,4.37,1.57,5.42,0,5.24,3.85,1.4,0.35,0.17,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,9.97,7.17,2.27,0.17,0.17,0,2.62,2.62,0,0.17,0,0,7.87,0.87,0,6.82,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,0.87,1.22,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.7,5.24,5.77,0.17,1.22,3.85,0.35,0,0.17,3.5,5.59,3.5,0.87,0,0,0,"Management"

I assume that she has not changed her teaching style over the past years. It wasreally frustrating following the concepts during her lectures, I became unmotivated to come to class because I did not understandher teaching, so I relied heavily on self\xe2\x80\x93study. I did not enjoy having to present in front of a camera, I did not consent to be filmed forthe group presentation and having it available to the rest of 80 students. This course was really frustrating to handle.Professor R clearly demonstrated her knowledge and expertise in organizational behavior. For the most part, the class atmospherewas very open to discussion which helped facilitate learning. I would have liked to see more supplemental work to help solidify theconcepts we learned (e.g. weekly practice questions). The midterm questions were also very ambiguous in their wording whichmade it hard to demonstrate that I understood the concepts presented in class. That being said, overall Dr. R was a great profThe instructor does not listen to students' questions and opinions. The professor only cares that every student needs to take in heropinion. Although she pretends to encourage everyone to speak in the class, she often just refute the student and say that it's justsupposed to be what she says in the class. She also does not give clear instructions for any assignments. The grading ofassignments is also graded by very generalized scales and the feedback often has criteria that were not in the task description. Shewanted us to tasks that she believe is useful for the career, but the fact that she is super restricted towards everything just killed anypossibilities. Everything happened in this course was a huge confusion. The main reason is due to the professor. She even suggested one of my friends in dropping the course. I believe this is not what Iwanted for in such a high ranked university. I highly regret taking this course with this professor. I believe my first exposure to theHuman Resources stream could be made better if it is taught by other professors. Now, I just hate human resources and killed allmy interests in going into this stream. I hope no one needs to suffer through this instructor again.The quality of the course is good.Instruction was good. Professor was always there when there was needed extra explaining.I was treated like an elementary school child\xe2\x80\x93 Teaching style was helpful, but at times inconvenient\xe2\x80\x93 Weekly reflections were useful for extra credit\xe2\x80\x93 Content could've been delivered in a more organized mannerI kinda don't get the point doing the assignment or the presentation. The teaching on how to do the assignment was grosslyinadequate. Also more simple slides!!!!it was clearThe instructor tries to encourage students to participate in group activities and encourages new ways of learning in the class, butshe is not at all clear with her instructions. The more she tries to explain and clear doubts the more confusing it gets to understandwhat we need to do.8.

! ! ! it was clearthe instructor tries to encourage students to participate in group activities and encourages new ways of learning in the class , butshe is not clear with her instructions . the more she tries to explain and clear doubts the more confusing it gets to understandwhat we need to do . 8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course . comments """,0.0531914893617021,0.0709219858156028,0.074468085106383,0.0425531914893617,0.0602836879432624,0.102836879432624,0.117021276595745,0.0354609929078014,0.049645390070922,0.0460992907801418,0.0638297872340425,0.0212765957446809,0.0319148936170213,0.0851063829787234,0.0851063829787234,0,0,0,0.00354609929078014,0.0425531914893617,0.0531914893617021,0.0673758865248227,0.0212765957446809,0.0177304964539007,0.0780141843971631,0.0886524822695035,0.0106382978723404,0,0.0673758865248227,0.0390070921985816,0.00354609929078014,0,0.00354609929078014,0.00354609929078014,0.00354609929078014,0.00354609929078014,0.0212765957446809,0.00709219858156028,0.0141843971631206,0.0212765957446809,0.0212765957446809,0.0212765957446809,0.00354609929078014,0.00709219858156028,0,0,0.00709219858156028,0.0177304964539007,0.00709219858156028,0.0212765957446809,0.0177304964539007,0.0212765957446809,0.0283687943262411,0.024822695035461,0.00709219858156028,0.0106382978723404,0.0319148936170213,0,0,0,0.00709219858156028,0,0.00709219858156028,0.00354609929078014,0.0709219858156028,0.0106382978723404,0.0141843971631206,0.00709219858156028,0.113475177304965,0.00709219858156028,0,0.024822695035461,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0.0460992907801418,0.024822695035461,0.0567375886524823,0.00709219858156028,0.0106382978723404,0.0638297872340425,0.0638297872340425,-0.00354609929078014,-0.00709219858156028,0,0.00354609929078014,0.0354609929078014,0.0354609929078014,0.0602836879432624,0,0,0.0567375886524823,0.0602836879432624,-0.0141843971631206,-0.00709219858156028,0.0567375886524823,0.00709219858156029,0.00354609929078014,0,0.00354609929078014,-0.00354609929078014,0.00354609929078014,0,"Organizational Behaviour","LEC02",2.8,2.8,"2.9",2.5,"2.4",2.3,"2.3","3.3",2.6,703,63.26,32.08,31.76,32.02,22.68,25.32,88.9,3.13,1.42,1,0.85,16.36,1.99,14.22,4.69,0.85,2.13,3.27,0.71,3.7,0,5.12,2.99,2.13,1.99,0.57,1.42,0,0.43,0.14,0,14.51,7.54,1.99,0.14,0.28,0.28,3.13,6.97,0.14,2.42,0,0.14,9.39,0.14,0,8.82,0.14,0.28,0,0,0,0,0.85,0.14,0.71,0.43,0.28,0.14,0,0,0.14,3.56,6.26,0.28,0.28,4.69,0.85,0.14,0.28,3.56,7.25,4.84,0.57,0.57,0.43,0,"Management"

The assignment and the presentation were the same thing being read a journal andsummarize your findings. None of this taught me anything about managing people and groups in organizations. Sure,the lecture were somehow applicable but the professor only want the answers to be provided her way. ""Comparecontrast personality and attitude"" How is one even supposed to answer to that? I swear all of my classmates wereconfused and I never heard anyone say anything good about this. She made this dumb exercise about managing people and ask students to give her 1$ which I heard some kids didn\'tget it back from some other lectures. 1. don\'t get money involved, this is a university. 2. it started getting pretty big of afight and people yelling at each other and someone literally came to me and said ""I want to throw a chair at this person""The prof was there, did she intervene to ensure everyone stays calm? no. She just let it escalate. Honestly sure she\'s good a teaching but making a curriculum and planning lectures, shes the worst, She doesn\'t gothrough all of her slides and is a little messy. Don\'t let her write the curriculum or assignments anymore. I don\'t knowanyone who learned something from that dumb assignment and presentation. First thing she does when she comes in lecture is brag about herself and assumes that everyone is in management.Does she know her course is a program requirement to other unrelated programs? My friend is in computer scienceand all she says in class all day long "" we are all management students and want to be CEO\'s right? "". The only thing she did that was good was lead the lectures and i will be honest shes good at explaining concepts butreally, this was by far one of the worst profs I have ever seen. Let me talk about this journal thing. Every end of lecture we have to answer some questions that she gives in class. Andhonestly, why are we even doing that? She answers them in class. She assumes everyone has a computer and willbring a computer to class. Does she knwo how heavy a computer is? And I don\'t have time to go take a picture, send itto my facebook, go to library, download the picture, upload it to the journal entry and send it. If she really wants this,accept soft copy. And at the end of the lecture I feel like it was a waste of time, we didnt even get feedback on them andshe asks on the last lecture if she can use it for her research. Uhm did you ask us to do this for your research or for ourlearning or what?the amount of coursework is fairly distributedgoodOverall, I learned a lot in this course. Everything was interesting.The assignments provided a focus on the appendix aspect of the textbook. Due to this, I feel the assignments were notrelevant to key course material.

It is understandable to have the midterm as 25% and final as 30%. However,assignments with weights as large as 15%-25% is unreasonable; feedback is given at the end of assignments, but notapplicable to future assignments making it difficult for students trying their absolute best to improve. Assignments wereunreasonably marked and feels subjective. Students trying to improve find it difficult as the professor does not tellstudents of allocation weight of questions in the midterm/final. The average for assignments/exams is not said as theprofessor, repetitively telling students that ""it does not help you"".The material taught in this course was very interesting and applicable to the field of management. However, the way itwas taught in class and explained was poorly done. I feel that concepts were quickly explained and majority of the classwas group work. Although I can appreciate the group work and how it created discussions, I don\'t think this method wasthe best for all the material taught in class. I think this course needs some more structure and better explanations ofmaterials. It was only while studying for exams that I actually began to understand material and realise that the coursewas, in fact, interesting. The course projects were also extremely similar in nature which, I felt, didn\'t help myunderstanding of course materials at all. As management students who don\'t have a lot of experience with academicand scholarly studies, the course projects felt detatched from the course itself and unecessary. This course has a lot ofpotential, I think it just needs to be taught to students with better methods.8.

Instructions for assignments wereunclear. Practicing content from the course is difficult to do as it must be confronted with the professor/TA in order for itto become an acceptable answer. At the same time, quality of feedback of the accepted answers is not insightful (sayfor an exam or assignment). Homework is given for most weeks, but it is not marked.

The assignments are worth out of very little marks compared to the amount of requirements thatare tacked onto them. I feel like she did this as a way to take off extra marks. For example, the world limit for theassignment was only 1000 words but she had a significant amount of requirements to fulfill. It was difficult to satisfy herexpectations without exceeding the word count. The marking scheme is also very strange. She would make anassignment out of 41 but give us a letter grade of B/B+...How does this relate properly? How can we know our progresswhen she doesn\'t even explicitly tell us our mark? She didn\'t even tell us how much our midterm was out of. She wasvery ambiguous in stating the multiple choice questions and the short answers would be weighted differently...Onceagain how can we know our progress when she is so vague on her marking schemes?The overall quality of the instructions in the course was good. Sometimes it was bit unclear.Very well organized instruction, very stimulating material, enjoyed coming to class everyday.The instruction was very good. The prof was very engaging and found a nice balance between teaching material andpractical exercises and activities. In addition, she constantly related it back to how it would apply to industries whichwas good.In lectures, the presentation of course content and explanations were done well. I noticed however, a lack of studentparticipation and interest in the material. Participation was heavily encouraged but I saw only a slight improvement instudent participation. For this course in particular, participation is vital to truly understanding the material.Ways to increase class participation would be to implement more case studies every week during class, andincreasing the weighting and importance of participation for the final marks of students. Students, I noticed, becomemore passionate about course material when a real-life case situation is presented to them. The instructor shouldexploit this passion to give students a better learning experience. Secondly, by increasing the weighting of participationon final marks, student will be more motivated to speak in class. Also, I recommend not collecting weekly assignmentsto count for participation. Perhaps have a TA note down who participates appropriately in class and award marks in thatsense. MGMB01 taught by Professor Dewan follows a similar structure and overall class participation is at a good level.goodThis class was interestingOrganization of lecture was not the best way to teach the course material. Could be betterThe instructor\'s lectures don\'t help a lotKind of confusing and the reading material is in no way accord with the class-material. The chapter load is annoyingand frustrating since we mostly play games in class, and then basically take the course as a self-study on the side withcountless chapters.I found the course instructor to be very vague and not very responsive when approached either via email or in person.This is a problem that should be seriously addressed. The course was made a lot more confusing and harder thannecessary. For example, on the midterm examination, the teacher asked as a question but said we cannot use theexamples used in class. This was shocking as we expected the exam would allow us to apply what we had learned butthe professor started to restricted and limit our options of information. In this sense, many students found itcondescending and unfair.there wast any ""teaching"" i didn\'t really learn anything new, i felt like i should have but nopeTo be honest, it\'s probably the worst experience i ever had since i started walking and i not even exaggerating . It is soabstract and not understandable especially the assignment i legit don\'t know what the prof wants. The overall qualitycompare to other courses, IS PHENOMENALLY BAD. Like for real, i hate accounting so much, if i were to choose tobecome an accounting major or study in this course ever again, i will DEFINITELY , WITHOUT hesitation, swear toGOD, JESUS, Mohamed Ali and trump that i\'ll choose the latter.The concept was quite hard to understand in this course, and there was no standard answer for reference. Porfessordid not explain clearly, I had troubles while doing my assignment and group project. Even though I asked for help, it didnot help a lot. I also asked my classmates, it seemed they were very confused as well. I spent a lot of time to read thetextbook on my own and still not get good mark in the test. I was still confused to many concepts now.Instruction was good, concepts were explained in detail and appropriate examples were given.just so soWorst professor ever. Never understand what is she talking about.not hlelpful to answer questions. And she ate everylecture.i feel the first assignment (written) is not that helpful in understanding organization behaviour.   Manage People & Grps in Orgs Organizational Behaviour-F-LEC01-Phanikiran Radhakrishnan-12/1/2016 6/12Other than that everything was interesting.The assignment is quit hard and difficult, it took more than the reasonable time for me to finish it. And the instructor\'steaching is sometimes not related to the course content and not helpful for the understanding of the course8. Please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse.'","b'CommentWe were able to email her but she would just tell us to look at the syllabus, even if the information wasn\'t available onthe syllabus.Prof had office hours and sometimes could emailProfessor was always able to assist through email and even speaking with her around the school.Assistance included going to her for office hours and TA\'s available. I didn\'t use any of it so no comment.TAs were rarely around. I wondered why they were even hired. They should take a more active role in the teaching andapplication of course material. Also, the blackboard portal is difficult to navigate. Please make it more user-friendly. soinformation is not missed. Also, post cases on the blackboard portal and have students write their own analysis to beused when participating in class so meaningful discussions can be had.noneTA and Professor did not reply emailsPoorReading assistance of the Writing Centre.There was not much help provided at all. Questions directed to the professor were replied with simply ""yes"" or ""no""responses leading to further ambiguity.there was none! i asked for an appointment for help on an assignment where i really would have liked to talk tosomeone face to face, but instead i got some TA guy from Mississauga who asked if Skype was okThere wasn\'t much, it is pretty much book memorizing course , even if there was any, still useless.Office hours, sample examsnot help me a lotWorst TA ever.

However, I don\'t think those help with my exams.For exams, it is merely swallowing up the whole book so you can ace the course.Excellent quality of the instruction in MGHB02Prof. tries to make the course fun with one exercise near the end of the lecture every time. The lectures were fine andinteresting enough. But the way she set up the homework schedules can really be improved. She only gave one weekof time for us to form a group and complete the end of year presentation. I hope she can let us prepare the presentationand the individual assignment earlier in the semester. Other than that, I think she\'s a good professor.Fine.The course was about memorizing definitions from the textbook, as can be seen from the midterm. We were neveractually taught concepts because ""they\'re in the textbook"" according to the professor. This course was about learningeverything yourself. I do not know how this course will help me in life considering that all I did was memorize definitionsand forget them after the exam. Very badly set up course. I know peers who had the course last summer with a differentprofessor and they loved it. This professor was more concerned with promoting the textbook and making our marksdepend on us having bought and used the textbook than actually teaching anything. It would have made no difference ifthere was no professor for this course and we were just told to read the textbook because that is essentially whathappened anyways, but this way we had to pay $1600 towards the professor\'s salary. Maybe not a bad course but itwas very very badly set up and the professor was useless.Confusing and too packed with informationDr. R incorporates creative activities/relevant videos in her lectures which really made me truly interested in the subjectmatter.8.

The question would take 2 seconds to answer; however, she resorts tobelittling us with that same remark. It\'s quite frustrating to seek help only to get shut down.Memorizing the WHOLE book.Excellent support for MGHB02Never met our TA or heard from him/her in this course. Perhaps we don\'t have one in this lecture?Fine.I asked the professor questions on two occasions, once by email and once in person. Both times, I was shut down andtold to ""Be a leader"" and ""Use my best judgement"". I was belittled and made to feel like I had wasted her time when infact it is her job to answer my questions and help me learn and succeed in the course. Once, I asked her what themidterm exam would cover and she told me to use my best judgement, for which there is email proof. She had neverexplicitly told us in class or via blackboard or any other method what would and would not be included on the midterm   Manage People & Grps in Orgs Organizational Behaviour-F-LEC03-Phanikiran Radhakrishnan-12/1/2016 6/12and although it was a simple enough question requiring one sentence in return saying what I needed to study, she tookthe low route and made me feel like a moron for not knowing the answer. Mind you, the midterm did not cover all of thematerial that we had learned up to that point, only select chapters which the professor did not want to say for some oddreason. I had asked m peers before emailing her and none knew for sure what to study and I did not want to risk mymarks on what I thought I should or should not study. Clearly, I would have been better off just not asking at all. Veryrude and useless professor. Others in the course also had similar experiences, as I learned after speaking to themabout what she had said to me and how rudely she had behaved over one simple question. This made me and othersin the course hesitant to ask questions in class or outside of class and instead we went to google. We do not pay$18,000 per year to learn from google, we pay to learn from the UTSC professors but clearly they couldn\'t care lessabout our learning or feelings for that matter. I have younger siblings and I absolutely will not let them waste their timeand money by coming to this school to learn from such disrespectful and useless professors when instead they couldjust google what they need to know.

Sometimes the lectures very confusing.The professor made the topic of compensation very interesting with the class structured as half lecture and halfdiscussion.- PROVIDE MORE DETAIL INFORMATION ON THE EXAM EVEN THE STRUCTURE AND NUMBER OF QUESTIONS (weknow nothing but ""there will be short answer questions"" before the exam)- Open book exam might not be the most appropriate way for a two-hour exam for almost 20 questions. Honestlycomparing with the other D-level HR courses, the exam materials didn\'t appeal to me much in terms of aligning withwhat we learned in class- Students are given CLEAR instructions in how to get the case for the 35% group project- The way how the group project was designed is VERY INTIMIDATING. It took WAY OVER average course load than anyother D-level HR courses. We needed to make an on-going commitment & time investment in the project throughoutthe month while studying for other courses\' exams and projects. Instead, the project can be just submit once towardsthe end of the semester. - CLEAR RUBRIC/INSTRUCTIONS ARE GIVEN on each part of the assignment. We didn\'t even know that we weresupposed to do to get a decent mark.- The class activities are written in a formal and clear word document- course materials are post in a more organized way- students are given clear mark break-down/rubric for assignments and group project - having an overall review of all course materials before the exam- provide instruction sheets in how to do excel work such as regression analysisneed to be more clear and organizedProfessor had a good speaking volume and pace. Not enough detail on course material provided in class, sometimesclass discussion would veer away from main points on a topic. Had many case-based examples to help understanduse of course material to real world. Powerpoint slides were over-simplified (prefer a bit more detail) and repetitive.Case assignment was very long and instructions were vague; case was also difficult to find (did not come with physicaltextbook when bought at bookstore, even though the professor said that it should).overall, the content was very vague, i never understood what was expected. The professor was confusing at times, andthe project was way too long and unreasonable. It was more stressful than the rest of my D level courses. Theprofessor knows a lot about the material she teaches, however she should improve some of her teaching methods.Better/thorough explanations and simpler or shorter projects would have made this class more reasonable. One thing iliked was that we got feedback for our work and were able to revise it, however the feedback was also too vague. I alsoliked that there were connections to real life, however I didn\'t like that we were expected to do the homework before thelecture,Overall quality was poor as instruction and for the final project was very vague and was not helpful even after askingquestions8.

When a group had a question, the response was vague, answered wrong, and notanswered at all. I would suggest improving communication with the students, making sure they understand completely.Throughout the course, whenever we had questions, they were rarely properly answered, and left us more confused. ididn't like that we were often told that it's because it's a D-level course, it's meant to be hard. I didn't think that was fair,because difficulty wasn't the issue, it was more clarity. Professor Radhakrishnan was very kind overall and i believe shewants us to gain as much as we can from her course, but I believe there are many improvements she can make.None""","b ' i think , there area lot of place for improvement . sometimes the lectures very confusing . the professor made the topic of compensation very interesting with the class structured as half lecture and halfdiscussion . - provide more detail information on the exam even the structure and number of questions ( weknow (nothing) not but "" there will be short answer questions "" before the exam ) - open book exam might not the most appropriate way for a two - hour exam for almost 20 questions . honestlycomparing with the other d - level hr courses , the exam materials didn\' t appeal to me much in terms of aligning withwhat we learned in class - students are given clear instructions in how to get the case for the 35% group project - the way how the group project was designed is very intimidating . it took way over average course load than anyother d - level hr courses . we needed to make an on - going commitment & time investment in the project throughoutthe month while studying for other courses\' exams and projects . instead , the project can be just submit once towardsthe end of the semester . - clear rubric/instructions are given on each part of the assignment . we didn\' t even know that we weresupposed to do to get a decent mark . - the class activities are written in a formal and clear word document - course materials are post in a more organized way - students are given clear mark break - down/rubric for assignments and group project - having an overall review of all course materials before the exam - provide instruction sheets in how to do excel work such as regression analysisneed to be more clear and organizedprofessor had a good speaking volume and pace . not enough detail on course material provided in class , sometimesclass discussion would veer away from main points on a topic . had many case - based examples to help understanduse of course material to real world . powerpoint slides were over - simplified ( prefer a bit more detail ) and repetitive . case assignment was very long and instructions were vague ; case was also difficult to find ( did not come with physicaltextbook when bought at bookstore , even though the professor said that it should ) . overall , the content was very vague , i (never) not understood what was expected . the professor was confusing at times , andthe project was way too xlong and unreasonable . it was more stressful than the rest of my d level courses . theprofessor knows a lot about the material she teaches , however she should improve some of her teaching methods . better/thorough explanations and simpler or shorter projects would have made this class more reasonable . one thing iliked was that we got feedback for our work and were able to revise it , however the feedback was also too xvague . i alsoliked that there were connections to real life , however i didn\' t like that we were expected to do the homework before thelecture , verall quality was poor as instruction and for the final project was very vague and was not helpful even after askingquestions8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse .

I got the impression that she wants her students to succeed. I like that she includes exercises inclass after we learn the material because it helps me better understand the concepts. However I found some of the instructions tobe a bit overwhelming. The exercises themselves weren't difficult, but parsing through all the information was often challenging.

Her instruction method is positively unconventional, and should stay that way. The professor facilitated a veryfriendly environment in which students may contribute to class discussions, or start them.General concepts were well explained. The amount of content taught within the class was significantly smaller thanthose required for the course and in the textbook.The professor was prepared for every lecture and was clear on what her intent was for us to learn. She also did anactivity to stimulate the class in order for us to get a better understanding of the lesson, which it did help.sometimes I did not know what instructor really want us do.very good professor and classmates- Very hypocritical. We are asked not to be afraid to ask questions and take initiative but sometimes we just needassurance and when I ask questions I usually never get a straight answer. I do understand that some things areobvious and some questions caAssignment is not closely related to course materialsMaterials are not properly organized which makes students hard to follow the logic and develop a deeperunderstandingIt is good but but it would be better if they give clearer instruction.I do not even know why is this course here for. It took me time and I did not feel it was useful and helpful in my furthercareer.The lectures were very stimulating and a great application of the textbook material we were required to read. Overall, itwas very good.Very disorganized professor.NEVER answers questions and is VERY RUDE (eats while talking to me which I find VERY disrespectful, makingembarassing comments in front everyone)!!! And then wonders why we never show up to her office hours. She alsogave me my assignment back all wet and torn, and they correct everything in pencil (even though I wrote my midtermwith pencil)I think the class acitivities conducted by the professor were really good. A little more help in terms of guidance for theassignments and course materials would help a lot. Also, the assignments were basically based on variables andhypothesis part of the course. Therefore, having two assignments were kind of repetitive but at the same time it gave usa in-depth understanding of the subject matter.Professor was very passionate about what she was teaching which made the course more interesting.NOTABLE FLAW IN COURSE: LECTURE NOTES AND HOMEWORK ARE UNORGANIZED IN BLACKBOARD, BEINGCOLLECTED INTO A SINGLE TAB. Please have them separately organized such that students can appropriate budgettheir effort accordingly.It\'s acceptable.The professor is professional but she doesn\'t reply and answer our questions as kindly as other profs. My friends and Isent her emails but she never answers the questions directly but said somethig like ""you should know the answer as afuture leader"" to all of us. And when we got our marks back for our presentation and we didn\'t get the mark we expected,and from her comment we think the professor misunderstand our article and our purpose so we emailed her to explainand see if we can get a regrade but she said stuff like ""I am so busy and I have many projects and many students"",which disppointed us. We believe that professors could say we didn\'t meet their requiement or expectation but we don\'tthink that ""im busy"" should be the answer of our regrading request.8.

She looks for a word for word explanation, without allowing any room for inference.She is incapable of looking past what you wrote, where you are basically right but rather you can only be literally right.She also gives ridiculous decimal marks over the ""overall quality of your assignment"".

There was a lot of open discussion,which can be good, but it felt as though their was no direction to the conversation and no concepts were learned.Professor Radhakrishnan was a good lecturer; she effortlessly stimulating and engaging class discussions. Weeklynegotiation role plays were a good way of learning, but to fully capitalize on the experience, I would\'ve preferred thatwe debriefed each role play in greater detail. It would\'ve helped if we had a set of notes to following along with as wewent through debriefing questions together.I found this course to be very helpful in the field of management mainly because the course material does not stackwith any other management course. The use of negotiations is social skill we must all learn as a businessmanwhether for salary or buying a car. This course not only allowed us to learn the theory behind it, but also let uspractice it in a controlled environment. The professor demonstrated outstanding knowledge in the field and was veryhelpful. She did a superb job with the \'participation coupons\' to engage the class in discussion about negotiations.The course material itself proved to be very useful and will be of continuous use in the future. I high recommend thiscourse and also recommend that it should be added on as an elective towards the management specialist program.My only negative comment is that the time slot is very late at night.class discussion is lively and helpful, many different thoughts!the timeline of this course is very unreasonable. It makes it difficult for us when the course is only 8 weeks and thefinal exam is at the end of April. It feels like the course was designed with longer preparing time than what we hadexperienced. Each class was very rushed and materials are not well presented. I realize the course content is moredescriptive but the professor was not clear on what she is expecting from us. When asked regarding how shewanted us to present our answers, the response was very vague and unclear. When grading our assignments, theanswers she looks for are very specific and has to be her words (even if it was the same thing described in differentways). After the assignments were returned to us, she refused to tell us the average and was mad at us for askingher about the average. She did not go over the assignment with us after it was returned and there are no commentsleft on the assignment for what we had done wrong. The overall experience of this course was unpleasant.She is insightful with the examples the instructor gives. I see this material to be useful in future.The professor talks too much and repeats the same thing a hundred times. She is very close minded and doesn\'thave an open mind when listening to the students. The grading is the course is very unfair and biased. Students withthe same answers received different grades and no marking scheme is provided. I don\'t think she is a goodprofessor for negotiation as she doesn\'t have a good approach to dealing with students. She always thinks she isright and doesn\'t give students the opportunity to speak the truth or what they think. Horrible professor.not much useful concepts .. readings were useless could teach the whole course to someone in 1 hr bc its that easyOne of the worst courses I\'ve taken at UTM. I was actually interested in it since the topic seemed beneficial, but afterthe first few classes I regretted taking it instantly. The Professor was not professional at all, not worthy to be UofTprofessor. She barely taught - the entire 8 weeks consisted of the students just forming into groups and arguingcases and then taking up answers with her. She never provided examples of how to negotiate, and some of hernegotiation strategy points she made in class seemed unethical (lying to a car buyer about the car not having been inan accident even if it has?!)The method of evaluation for students was poor - one written report that was marked unnaturally hard. She also didnot give us any exam format pointers or study tips! The late timing of the class (6-9pm) on a Monday evening wasalso not helpful and participation became a bore especially with handing out ""tickets"" to participating students. It isalso very unhelpful to have a final exam an entire month after the course has ended!! Either we should have an in-class exam when the lectures finish in 8 weeks or have no exam at all. I definitely would not recommend this course which is sad because the course description actually seemedinteresting.8.

In the future, a limit should be placed on group size (e.g. three orfour students). Also, I think the groups should be diversified to include students from various engineering disciplines.Lectures were well done. Making the resources on Portal more organized would have been helpful, perhaps by havingthe lecture notes separate from the homework submission pages.The professor made the course content seem much less dull than it was.Instruction was done well and was enjoyable with a mix of lecture material and hands on activities. Emphasis wasplaced on the practical applications of lessons. More concrete information regarding exams could be used.Very boring. Too much time in class for so little concrete content. The bane of my existence for the past semesterProfessor was patient and understandingliked the in class activities such as sugar cube construction, manager vs employee, role play etc etc. Very helpful inexperiencing the real-life application of the theories. The assignments and project was not that helpful. I found the inclass participation writings are even more reflective and helps me understand the subject materialmehGoodMaterial was good but assignments were confusing, lacked structure, excessive, and did not help me in understandingmaterial. I enjoyed the in-class participation activities part of the course and felt it was much more helpful thanassigments.I like coming to the lectures, however I think the slides could be a bit more structured to suit Engineering students.The course was quite interactive which made it interesting to attend. It would have been better if the marks that we get inthe course are regularly updated so that students have an idea of how well they are doing in the course.- For assignment 1, we did not receive any proper instructions on how the assignment should be completed until aweek before the submission date, and even then, the Professor was absent from class and she left the TAs in charge.The assignment was essentially a personality essay that required academic research, the course quickly went from afun weekly organizational lecture to this academic paper and we had no preparations for it.- The classes were long and tedious at times.Lectures were stimulating all due to Prof. Radhakrishnan. Discussions were informative and entertaining. The only thing I can suggest for improvements are the instructions in the assignments. Some parts are very vague andconfusing. Overall a fantastic course to those whom actually wants to learn about the subject.The role-play and in-class activities were stimulating for students. However, there are times where I did not learn muchout of the session as we were expected to answer questions right after activities.Also, I felt that the tutorial sessions following the lecture times are not utilized fully as it was just a filler time when thelectures become longer.She's okay, but i did not appreciate having to do all of the in-class writing. I get that people won't show up for lecturewithout it, but if the content was a little better than that wouldn't be an issue.The instruction was well organized and well paced but I feel that it was intentionally kept to a very basic level whichended up degrading the relevance of this course.Great instructionProfessor was knowledgeable, but I didn't feel like I was able to connect the material into real life.Instructions for assignments/project were not very clear. General guidelines were given on paper but the Professornever covers them in class. Only mentioning when it is due. She also does not provide assistance in interpreting theassignment, and refers to the TA's when asking any question regarding them.There are in-class assignments every lecture where we reflect on questions written a slide. On her slides, theProfessor has many rhetorical questions written, but it is not clear which ones are to be for the in-class assignments.The Professor also talks over her slides making it difficult to concentrate for the in-class assignment. I have requestedthe Professor to indicate which slides are for the assignment on the slide itself, but she seems to avoid the suggestion.   PEOPLE MGMT. & ORG.

I went to the TA and she referred me to the other TA for the answer. It seemed like neither the Professor, norone of the TA's knew how to answer the question regarding the assignment.The Professor also did not have office hours. The TA's were somewhat helpful if they knew how to answer thequestions.

It was a fun course overall. It would be a nice idea in the futureto perhaps to invite guest lecturers - people or students from this course who have taken management positions.I would like more theory. Discussion is good but more theory to build on is needed.The Instructor was good but the lectures were too long.was okUnorganized, nonpractical, and not applicable to a course related to the engineering business minor. The professorwas a researcher, which as engineering students, is not the type of viewpoint I was expecting to learn about OB forprofessor is very chill, lecture slides don\'t have much course material, suggested readings have very little correlationswith the lecture material, do not like the role play activitiesThis course was one of the most subjective and biased courses that I have ever taken in all of my educationbackground. The professor is very biased and subjective and is often very quick to shut down other point of views basedon her own beliefs. It took the Professor a whole month to get my assignment remarked when professors usually returnremarked assignments in 1-2 weeks. She lacks professionalism and real life work experience. It is really hard to listenand trust what you are learning when the person that is teaching you has no professional experience in thecorporate/work life. Somebody with actual management experience will be better suited teach about peoplemanagement.The professor was good and approachable. However, I did not like the grading system for the written assignmentbecause Anny (TA) and ""the other TA"" marked in a different way. Also, the course is heavily based on talking to studentsabout scenarios, problems or basic concepts and it was hard to understand the other TA.Great. TA\'s with industry knowledge incredibly helpful.Lack of in-depth knowledge was shared and applicability to practical situations. Most of the material was mis-leadingand did not provide a balanced view on how organizations operate.The professor hardly taught us any useful knowledge that could be applied in this field. All conclusion of in classquestions were discussion among peers which is highly inappropriate. lectures were highly un-informative as theprofessor only read the slides that she pre-made and went in circles which do not answer her own question. All classactivity was somewhat interactive but highly unnecessary as professor sometimes simply walk out while students areengaging.The instructor was good, but the 3 hours lectures were long and I was bored with the content after the first 30 minutes.8.

Furthermore, the lecture slides were pretty suffice.Email correspondence was very prompt.The TA's were really good, helpful and fun to work with.was okAnny Fong is literally the best TA I've had at this university and would've taught the course in a more effective capacityGood teaching assistants that tried to balance and help students understand the knowledge we learnt from a practicalstandpoint.The TA Anny, was amazingly helpful and always reachable.

Theywere not appropriately delved into.Extremely disorganized. Instructions unclear. Class pacing is all over the place. Expectations for assignments andprojects are not specified correctly.It\'s got interesting subject matter but the slides and documentation is presented in a very sloppy way in my opinion. Iwould have preferred more concise and focussed slides or even just a 3-5 page handout for each lecture outlining themain points so I could focus more on the discussion in class.The content coverage is kind of slack, but the structure is solid. I like the way how this course is organized, but too much""common sense"" instead of theories, quite practical though.The instructor was of low quality in comparison to the other instructors I\'ve had. Poor organizational skills. Poorpresentation skills. Did not provide stimulating projects/assignments for the students. I think she needs to be replacedQuality of the instruction was okay. The number of powerpoint and extra sheets listed on blackboard for a given lectureis a bit absurd. It was very hard to follow lectures as the instruct would constantly flip between materials without sayingwith set of slides she was currently using. All of the slides should be in one powerpoint and in the order in which theyare going to be presented. Further, our instructor did not cover all the material that was testable, instead she said toread the book, but did not provide how much of the book content we should know. The tutorial role play was not wellexecuted, and the assignments could be more reflective of the material we are learnign and less research based.I really appreciated the role-play activities, since they allowed us to practice what we learned in a controlled environmentso that we may improve on our behaviours, mentalities and approaches for real business encounters. I alsoappreciated the concise lectures, which were wholly practical and weren\'t spammed with the noise of abstractedtheories and what not. Prof. Radhakrishnan connected with us and showed her eagerness to teach us and to hear ourvoices as well, which motivated me to learn the content and to apply the positive points that I have taken away from thecourse. Overall, Prof. Radhakrishnan was engaging and made the course relevant to the students.Overall poor teaching from the professor and learning progress was low. Three main issues exist in current JRE420 course:1. Professor Radhakrishnan showed low teaching passion and negative professional attitude -- finishing class earlyfrequently; never showed up in tutorial (leave early); loosely organized course materials and course teaching.2.Inappropriate grading scheme of the course -- with 30% focus solely on one team oral presentation which does notbase on any previous written assignment. One error of an oral sentence could lead to significant change in final marksof this 400+ course. Therefore the grading on this presentation tend reflect low justice and high randomness.3. Grading process of this 30% presentation is also unreasonable -- the only two TAs were divided into twopresentations to grade the presentation individually (two sessions have different presentations going onsimultaneously) which leads to less reference in grading. And Professor Radhakrishnan herself did not show up in thepresentation session. (at least not showed up the whole time at my group\'s presentation session)8.

Example when asked for advice on good websites for searching researcharticles: ""just search harder"". Insulting responses.TA\'s were cool and chill to discuss ideas about the course with, I did love the open way of communication withinstructors and TA\'s in this course, made it fun to discuss.For lectures, I hope the instructor could emphasize more on introducing theories so that students could build up a morestructural and systematic understanding of the course material, instead of saying ""WOW, that\'s quite interesting, I neverthough that way"",and forgot what it was about after class.Anny and Teng Teng were extremely resourceful and approachable, and acted (quite literally) as pillars for the coursewith their own instruction during tutorials.

So did some other activities we took inthe classes.I really like this course because we have a lot of group projects in this term. This course promoted our team spiritsand we all enjoyed it.boring and not practicalToo many assignments which takes us lots of time.This course gives me lots of opportunities to work in a team and get to know the importance of teamwork and how tomake a team function wellI can see the importance of the course but found the material constantly repeating itself and overemphasized. Ibelieve the course would have been more effective if taught in a few seminar like sessions, similar to the leadershiplectures we have. I also found that the instructor did not discuss or remind due dates of assignments.OKthe interactive with the instructors is helpfulThe course lacks structure and there no guidance provided on how to complete assignments. Due dates are notalways clarified. The professor needs to build a clear lesson plan prior to class.I really enjoy the course. Actually it seems too short for me. I learnt a lot and gain a deeper understanding about teambuilding and how to work with others in a manner most conducive to each team member.The instructor of this course was kind but was patronizing. For example she gave out candies for participation, whichalthough appreciated, is a ridiculous way to motivate graduate students. At this level, people weren't participatingbecause of the subject matter and pointless activities. I did not learn anything new and felt the course's assignmentswere time-wasters in a busy course schedule.The amount of emphasis the instructor put on our team was frustrating. I wholeheartedly agree that bonding withyour team is important, but in real life you will not have the opportunity to spend so much time with a single one.Therefore this course should have also emphasized adjusting to new teams rather than constantly analyzing thestrengths and weaknesses of our one team. It was redundant.Prof is great and tries hard to get the students engaged, but the students just aren't interested in learning about teambuilding.Too many reflection assignments. Reflection assignments tended to be more time consuming than useful,especially since some of the information seemed a bit repetitive.8. Please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning inthis course.""","b'CommentI have to admit team building is a very difficult course for me at first. I was not so confident with my English and I waskind of shy to speak and compete in front of other people, but this course let me develop a lot through different kindsof competitions and I now feel better in my group and feel very happy after our members finish one goal together.The materials posted on the blackboard helped me understand the elements in team building.be more practical and more casesThe handout specify the objectives and what we should learn to do in a team environment are available, useful andeasy to understandOKNo assistance was provided throughout the course.I believe the assistance given back for case competition feedback and other presentations was not supportive. I thinkit was unfair to name particular people who were weak, and to specify the names of people who did somethingincorrect as it will affect their future performance and cause them to feel insecure. I think providing general feedbackto the group and not specific names would have been more supportive .   LEADERSHIP & MGMT OF TEAMS MGT1260H-LEC0101 - MGT1260H - Phanikiran Radhakrishnan - 06/12/2051/39The grading of some group assignments was not so fair.

For example some majorconcepts that are asked about are not made obvious or bolded, they are hidden in bullet lists and easily overlooked. The professor does not seem to properly understand the actual definition of introversion/extroversion. As an introvert, Ifelt as if I was constantly being degraded and attacked for not being ""social enough"" or ""outgoing enough"". She wasperpetuating the stereotype that introverts are depressed recluses and strengthening the extrovert-preference ofsociety. This kind of misinformation is completely unacceptable for a university course. I would recommended some ofSusan Cain\'s works to better understand the concepts. I understand that for someone who is extroverted, it is difficult tolook from the POV of an introvert (and vice versa), but I would really appreciate if the professor would put some effort intounderstanding. The kind of information she is giving can be very hurtful and damaging.Very disorganized.Nearing the end of the semester and I\'m still quite not sure how all these topics converge into a useful idea, or what thepoint of the course even was.The quality of instruction was very informative and explored all aspects of the topics presented. In terms of instructionduring class, I enjoyed the format to which we spent maybe half the lecture on the presentation, some on discussionand some on role-playing/activities. It really helped to grow discussion in class and how involved we got. It was alsobeneficial that it related back to practical applications and what we as students can relate to.She did a great job making the course interactive and engaging. The class as a whole got to know each other and worktogether in many activities thanks to her. Those type of activities and engagement never happens in engineeringcourses so it really helped to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter.The quality of the teaching is good, however the subject matter I found to be quite bland and uniteresting. Although thismight be my personal opinion on the matter, i know that many other students feel this way too. The use of roleplaysgave an interesting change of pace, but it did not help to retain my interest for more than a few minutes. The use ofvideos and then analyzing them afterwards was much better at holding my attention. I find it a shame that a class taughtby a professor that clear knows the subject matter well can be so easy to tune out of. Also the length of a single lectureis simply too long. It is impossible to remain focussed and attentive for 3 hours straight.the blackboard was extremely confusing to navigatei loved the atmosphere she created in class and how she recognizes all of us and provides a lot of individual help.many other instructors do not develop individual relationships with their students. the roleplays were nice andentertaining and relating to what we learn and helped understand the course material. case studies and thepresentation were helpful too. i felt like the first assignment was not really focused into what we were learning. It wasmostly about finding the right articles rather than understanding what you were explainingReally couldn\'t understand her ppt.A feel like all of the material presented was very surface-level. We never ended up diving in to details.A great instructor, could tell that she truly wanted the class to learn. The addition of role play exercises was a great toolin making the 3 hour lectures more fun and educational.I thought that the course was well taught, the fact that we didn\'t sit in a typical lecture for 3 hours and were doinginteractive games and role plays truly helped me understand the material betterThe course material was somewhat dry, and I never had the capacity to put my full attention towards the lectures.Activities were an enjoyable learning experience, though.The marking in the course is somewhat subjective. And since the final exam will be the same for everyone, includingpeople from other lecture sections with different professors, the fact that other lecture sections are doing somethingdifferent is odd to me.please make the final easyThe professor was great, but the content of this course seemed a little... unnecessary. I might just be incredibly great atdealing with people and teams, but I felt like most of it was just common sense and I can\'t say I really /learned/anything.Phani is a good prof. The pregnant TA taught one lecture, which was absolutely horrible.I thought this course was going to teach us concepts of People Management , Organizational Behaviour, which is thename of the course. It was more of a 3 hour therapy session. Did not really learn anything except for meeting a few   PEOPLE MGMT. & ORG. BEHAVIOUR JRE420H1-F-LEC0103 - Phanikiran Radhakrishnan - 12/7/2016 5/15good people and re-affirming basic, common sense, concepts.The role playing is somewhat not stimulating. Maybe it\'s just because I don\'t really like role playing. Not everyone isexcited about doing it so most of the role playing time seemed to be wasted.The course provide pretty good explanations for all the required topics. I pretty enjoy the relaxed environment this coursehas created for me.However, the topics and exercise from this course are too theoretical. Some of the exercise won\'t work in the real life.Especially if you have already gained job experience before taking this course, you would realize that the lots of thetopics need to be adjusted for the real life situation.Overall, it\'s a good course-role play was very effective to help understand concepts -assignments/participation sheets were clear and usefulI found that the instruction documents for this course were very lengthy. It could have been more conscie, making iteasier to understand the expectations of the assignments or projects.Very good quality.The instruction quality was pretty good. The usual lecture slides are necessary but the added in class activities kept meinterested. Overall, the instriction quality was great.Not always super clear when it came to assignments and expectations in assignments, but lectures were veryinteresting and engaging.I like the candy and activities. Prof was nice. We didn\'t have tutorials which was nice. She let us go home early. Some ofthe lectures were a bit dryInstruction of the course was great. I was not a fan of the topics but overall teaching quality was good.-lecture portion of the class was good and was kept to a good length.-loved the money activity, I learned more in that class than I have in any lecture in years.-I really disliked the format of the presentations.... tough to learn about the concepts when we had to cram all of theminto one class. Also, we couldn\'t ask questions during the presentations like we would have been able to in a traditionalclass setting.8.

They were quite responsive to emails, but I haven't required a lot of their assistance since I wasn'tsure what I was supposed to be learning majority of the time.Powerpoint slides were helpful, but it would be better if the powerpoints were on PDF or in a more logical ordering pereach lecture.

She creates a friendly atmospherein class, and is very good at condensing the material into manageable lectures that are stimulating and not energydraining or boring. Both TA's I had a positive experience with, however Anny led my tutorial so i'll primarily talk about her. She's veryengaged in the subject matter and appears to be genuinely interested during tutorial. As a result, she stimulatesreally good class discussions. She has excellent dominance over the material and is great at exemplifying its realworld use. One of THE best TA's I've had in my undergrad as wellAs a final note, both the TA's and the professor were always concerned with us bettering ourselves constantly duringthis course. They really wanted us to excelI thought the course was taught very well. The instructor structured each day of lecture to be 1/3 listening to thelecture and the other 2/3 actually applying what was discussed in the first 1/3 of the class. This kept the courseinteresting for me because it was not just sitting listening to 3 hours of lecture; we were actually learning by doing,which kept in interested in the course material.the instruction in this course is very clear and straightforward. The instructors would clarify the material as soon aspossible once there was misunderstanding.Less emphasis needs to be placed on research - more emphasis needed on negotiating and conflict resolution.It was goodCombination of lecture note and role play does help me apply things we learned to the activity and it makes materialmore interesting.The instructor went into depth in each of the assignments - what was required and how it should be presented(explaining in class). This was very helpful.The role-plays were very interesting and I was able to meet new friends. This course is very different compared toengineering courses.The instructor was okthe slides were sometimes very unclear, they lacked logical flow, important variables were often not defined justexamples were given, your method of explaining studies on slides were weirdI highly disliked these projects. The instructions for both were incredibly unclear, it was hard to understand what youwere asking, there were so many details about what you wanted scattered all over the place, the majority of the timefor both projects was spent on figuring out what this project was asking of usThe projects also seemed unrelated to this corse. As a engineering business course we want to know the subjectmaterial, we want to know how it applies to us and ways to become better leaders. And the lecture materialsdefinitely provided that but the projects did not. The projects were just learning how to do research and statisticalreferences and if we were actually majoring in organizational behaviour then learning how to read and interpret andcreate these kinds of studies would be very important to our studies. However no one in this course is looking tomajor in organizational behaviour or psychology or anything like that. We are simply engineering students who wantto take the information and studies that organizational behaviour students and researchers have conducted and put itto practical use. so for future courses it would be better for this particular course to be more learning about thematerial and how to apply it rather then doing research and studies.8.

(less) not emphasis needs to be placed on research - more emphasis needed on negotiating and conflict resolution . it was goodcombination of lecture note and role play does help me apply things we learned to the activity and it makes materialmore interesting . the instructor went into depth in each of the assignments - what was required and how it should be presented ( explaining in class ) . this was very helpful . the role - plays were very interesting and i was able to meet new friends . this course is very different compared toengineering courses . the instructor was okay the slides were sometimes very unclear , they lack xlogical flow , important variables were often not defined justexamples were given , your method of explaining studies on slides were weirdi highly disliked these projects . the instructions for both were incredibly unclear , it was hard to understand what youwere asking , there were so many details about what you wanted scattered all over the place , the majority of the timefor both projects was spent on figuring out what this project was asking of usthe projects also seemed unrelated to this corse . as a engineering business course we want to know the subjectmaterial , we want to know how it applies to us and ways to become better leaders . and the lecture materialsdefinitely provided that but the projects did not . the projects were just learning how to do research and statisticalreferences and if we were actually majoring in organizational behaviour then learning how to read and interpret andcreate these kinds of studies would be very important to our studies . however (no_one) not this course is looking tomajor in organizational behaviour or psychology or anything xlike that . we are simply engineering students who wantto take the information and studies that organizational behaviour students and researchers have conducted and put itto practical use . so for future courses it would be better for this particular course to be more learning about thematerial and how to apply it rather then doing research and studies . 8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning inthis course .

Instructor was not familiar with the subject matter of themock case and was not even present for our mock case and case comp presentations. The only useful part of the course was themock case, which could have been covered in another course instead. Overall our time and energy would have been better spenton our many other courses instead of having MGT1160 at all. I do not feel that I have learned anything from the instructor or thiscourse overall.Lots of work, but not helpful, in the sense that they are not deep but they just add to our workload. The professor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer muchinsight during lectures and lecture hours were mostly assigned for us to discuss, which mostly end up with pointless small talks.The professor\xe2\x80\x99s lecture lack charisma and much concrete knowledge that can help us. The presentations made we feel bad aboutour communications skills without offering an effective way to help improve them. The professor never got back with our scores forassignments that we put in much work, such as a self recorded video about values (of which the topic was very generic andirrelevant to our program of studies.) This course overall provides unnecessarily heavy workload on top of our already heavytechnical course load, a few hours every week on average to listen to lectures with no charisma and little help on communicationskills.It\xe2\x80\x99s fine but it\xe2\x80\x99s just a waste of time in such an intensive semesteruselessIn terms of the mock case write up, the instructions were very vague and communication was rather poor from the TAs as to whatwas required.noDisorganized class. Recommend to make it more structuredI honestly cannot believe that we pay this much in tuition for a course of this quality. Absolutely the worst class i ever have ever takenI felt lectures were very unstructured. Classes felt like a free\xe2\x80\x93for\xe2\x80\x93all. Very low attendance rates. Lacked communication about whatwould be covered in the class. We would start out class with no guidance\xcd\xbe I found myself asking the TA what we were supposed tobe doing as everyone was waiting for instruction on how to proceed.goodThis instructor did NOTHING HELPFUL!!! Every class she came in giving out candies and then sat somewhere at the back rowsdoing nothing. She is the WORST teacher I have ever met so far!!! An extremely terrible learning experience in her classes!the professor has no understanding of accounting, she cannot help us with the case she provided us.The instruction is integrative but too complex and time consuming. Moreover, it is not majorly communication\xe2\x80\x93focus. Feedbackshould be given more promptly.goodIt motivates teamwork.I cannot say enough how useless this course is in such an intensive program. It's not only taking up a large amount of time, but it'salso helpless and pointless. I don't see any point in having this time\xe2\x80\x93consuming course since nobody's communication skills areimproved.This course was absolutely unnecessary. I learnt nothing, it was not structured and feedback came relatively slow. Most classeswas pointless since we did nothing. Our questions were not being answered effectively. It\xe2\x80\x99s titled as communication but little wasdone to improve actual speaking skills. It started out well but when it got to the middle there was nothing left to do. So this courseshould be a one day workshop not a course.I don't think it is necessary to learn such a course during MMPA programIt improves students' presenting skills but it's not a practical coursevery goodI think this course is meaningless. The professor just handout the material of mock cases, and all time left is for discussion. I gainnothing from both the courses and from the professor's teaching. I think this course should be cancelled or should be redesigned. Ithink the professor should teach some useful expressions and words to improve communication ability for international students.Moderate.I cannot see any preparation from her class. For a lot of classes, she just let us discuss by ourselves which is a waste of time andmy tuition.Good instructor have comprehensive knowledgeRadhakrishnan_Phanikiran_MGT1160H_COMMUNICATIONS MGT1160H-F-LEC0101_12/6/2019 4/168.

Her layout of the class is good. sometimes micromanages.I HATED this course. It was the most useless thing I have ever taken It was a waste of my 16k tuition. The structure, theprof and everything about this course was a complete waste of my time. I would not recommend this course to anyone. Whoever makes the decision to hire profs and design courses should seriously either get rid of this course or find aprof who can actually teach. It was 100% a waste.The professor was not helpful at all. This entire course was self taught with little to no instruction from the professor.Anytime I asked her a question in class or during office hours she did not clarify anything but instead was verycondescending and said, ""This is so easy; you should know"". She also refused to remark midterms or even speakabout them if someone felt the mark should be higher.Every case felt like it was the same thing over and over again. Didn\'t understand a lot of the conceptsNo structure given, seems like the lessons were done on the fly.Overall quality was great.The instruction, when it happens is good. I feel like we were left to do our thing and there was very little guidance oractual instruction. We would have in class negotiation sessions then sometimes not have a debriefing. So, we endedup gaining a lot of practical skill and very little ""knowledge"" or ""terms"". And then in the midterm that is what we gradedon, not the practical knowledge. Very annoying.I found that lectures weren\'t clear and that there was no clear objective with the lesson plans. They were not direct and Ileft with confusion about the subject matter.disorganized and hard to understand assignments, what is expected, etc.Taught wellInteresting class structure. Appreciated the hands-on negotiation we got to doVery much what i expect from a university-level course. Professor is excellent. The professor isn\'t shy about beingpersonable (which is rare and great). Professor encourages student participation and manages it well.

Everything had a clear goal and purpose which makes me motivated to follow them.Instructor was always very well prepared, and activities were very relatable to what we were learning. Amazing structureto the course.niceI liked the way Professor taught the course, it is a very practical way of learning. This course is not about memorizing. Ithink maybe this course will be the one I would remember more. It was very practical, the activities, and journals. I likedwe always tried to connect real life with the theories and concepts.Well designed lectures, interactive with class. Examples, activities in class, weekly journals were helful to understandtopics.Sometimes felt as though I was being talked down toIt would be better if we could use computers to type our answers for midterm and final exams.Instruction method was good with class activities, lecture slides, and roleplays. Would recommend that the testingmaterial and assignment sheets be better flushed out and detailed. There were many details that also had to beclarified during the midterm and assignment (ex. What insights doe the theory provide?). Recommend to make moreexplicit in questions (ex. what do you mean by insights). Also please put due date on assignment handout rather thanjust blackboard submission link and clearer rubrics. Currently have checklist of items to include but if everything ischeckmarked is this a full marks. On individual assignment there was a sliding scale but there was little detail as towhat constituted the lowest mark vs highest possible mark in the scale other than prompting questions. Also if a studyis introduced there are many limitations to them, would be good to introduce these limitations so we can keep them inmind when looking at the results. Some of the course material and textbook make general statements too much (ex.statement in textbook that undergraduates are full of confidence/too confident, seniors are not hired much). Forexample, in the second statement, this might be true for some jobs but not highly specialized jobs (ex. surgeon,anesthesiologist) which should be taken into account when saying these statements and because we are mostlyexposed to these jobs as undergraduate engineering students.Classes were very good and learning through activities was enjoyable. Group project was too theoretical. It would havebeen nice if that was a little more applied as well.The prof uses lots of real life experience to make a deeper understanding of concepts to me and I found that they arevery useful, and let me understand more on real life behaviorOverall good8.

There was a lot of interaction and discussion withinthe classroom which I found to be beneficial.The quality of the instruction and the course was partially good as the instructor was enthusiastic, however the actualcontent was somewhat basic knowledge and repetitive, simply talking about 5 main skills managers need. In addition,the assignment instructions were already unclear, the assignment was boring and tedious, it was not mentallychallenging nor interesting. The course revolved around skills an individual acquired, and did not lead into anythingnew over the time period. Much of the content was similar to psychology and not really going in depth aboutmanagement itself, more about people personally. The majority of the lectures were just discussion that the teacherwas asking, not necessarily relating to the textbook or learning anything new, instead we were just analyzing our ownskills.- Intersting and funny exercises in class but did not contributed to understanding the material better- Course material not really covered in class- Lecture slides, material and syllabus disorganized (material from last year, changing course outline) ->- Disorganization and the lack of leadership seems to be repetitive occurring problem with courses in the managementdepartment -> Examples: Bailey\'s disastrous Eco100 courses and STA 218 in fall 2016 to name just a few- Assignments announced too late to make any meaningful contribution to this subject- Use of inappropriate language -> For example the words ""retarded teenager"" was used in one example for ourhomeworkVery informative professor, patient and helpful.badfineThe overall atmosphere of the class was fun and interacting.Professor R was amazing! I feel a deeper understanding of what I want to do with my life, and just a general direction ofmy career after taking this course, so I owe her.Every lecture was interesting, and actually had so many practical workplace skills. This course and Professor R areESSENTIAL to the Commerce program.very engaging, I learned a lot from the activities provided in classNice instructor and very helpful.It was good, lectures were engaging and informativeI thought I took PSY100 once again but with a different course code. Basically, the content of the course consists of 3-4chapters from PSY100. Although I liked the professor and her warming personality, the course content was awful. Iwould not recommend this course to anyone who took PSY100, and for those who haven\'t taken it I would definitelysuggest to take Psychology instead.This is an course require high involvement .Good.She is greatinstructions were vaguegood professor really interestingI learned a lot through this course.8.

However she was always veryunclear about many things concerning the subject matter and any assignments. In addition, I emailed the TA regardinga poor mark that I received because I was shocked because I worked efficiently and put a lot of time and effort into myassignment answering all the questions. The TA said she ""once you review the comments, you may submit for a re-grade\' although she never followed up, there was never an announcement on blackboard, nor an area created to re-submit my assignment.

She is very knowledgable and pleasant. 4 hours of the course on a Fridaynight made it hard to stay engaged the entire lecture.The instructor is fair.

The written assignment could be a bit more fun and engaging.The quality of the instruction of the course is good, just that the material was always rushed and did not cover the whole chapter.Often, the lecture only touched on a few aspects of the chapter, leaving students to learn the rest by themselves. Material that wouldbe covered on the midterm should be identically covered in lecture, leaving no need for the students to go home and learn themajority of the chapters on their own.Prof Radakrishnan is a very knowledgeable professor and she can make sure students learn the correct information by havingdiscussions in class.

Prof assumes that everyone ""learned"" everything during lecture ,even ifmany slides were skippedShe teaches in a different way from the course coordinator, I am little worried about the exam since the stuff learnedmight be different from other section.Prof. Radhakrishnan is a very good professor. I think the most beneficial learning outcome I had from this course was updating my resume. As a fourth year student I wish I had taking this course sooner, since I think that feedback could have helped me get aPEY job. I particularly liked the weekly written reflections. I think reflecting back on material is a beneficial way to help learn thematerial that is often underused. Part of what we need to do is to give good feedback, but we also need to actually give feedback in the first place. I wonder if more students fill out course evaluations for this course since we actually learn how to provide goodfeedback in this course. I\'m struggling to think of what I would improve for this course. Perhaps it would be better if groups got to choose their presentation topics out of a slightly larger pool of topics on afirst come first serve basis? I think my group had a more difficult topic than other groups that was harder than some other groups to understand andillustrate. I\'m not sure if this is the best way to address this concern since having variety in the presentations is a good thing.Too many instructions. Instructions were way too wordy and unclear. Sometimes having only a few set of conciseinstructions are better. For the assignment and the project, it was hard to ascertain what the professor actuallyexpected. Statistics are extremely important for understanding organizational behavior and provide clearer explanations,but focusing way too much on statistics without providing us with theories and focus on intuitions behind the conceptsmade it a terrible learning experience for me as a student who did not take a statistics course, which the professorseems to assume that everyone is aware and know great deal about it. We should be given some of the core statisticalconcepts and how they are used in conducting research in the area of the course. We had to read over a lot of researchpapers with an understanding of such statistical concepts and mathematical values that explain things, which studentshad to make a lot of effort into understanding them.ExcellentThe lecture is too abstract. There is no concrete information being taught in lecture and although lecture is entertaining,it is not directly related to the course content.The course was taught as more of a psychology course rather than a management course, I think the opportunity isthere to teach some great tangible skills but there is too much of a focus on the academic aspect rather than thepractical industry aspect.8. Please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in thiscourse.'","b""Commentnot much support needed. staff was available for asking questions, which was niceEmail to Prof and TAs.The emails sent to the instructor and teaching assistants to clarify simple things were replied in a very poorly mannerand in the case for detailed questions, I do not even want to talk about how poorly they were replied. I have never seensuch level of emails from an instruction ever in any sort of studies in trying to understand what the instructor is trying toteach which is the job of the instructor. The professor seemed to have different perceptions for different students or how she seems to prefer some studentsover other students, which were clear on how she handled different questions brought up by different students after theend of the lecture. I am not sure why I actually had to feel that I was treated poorly when clarifying some of the stuffs thatother students also seem to ask but were treated fairly. Without the teaching assistants who were very informative andhelpful in clarifying them, I would have probably dropped the course and had taken a different course.   PEOPLE MGMT. & ORG.

The in\xe2\x80\x93class discussions helps develop more depth in topics. The activities can sometimes be hit ormiss, but a majority of them are a hit and they emphasize the topics learned in lecture. The professor explains theconcepts pretty well. I don't think there's any topic taught that I don't understand. However, sometimes there are caseswhere you ask the professor a question, but before you finish asking, she interrupts because she thinks sheunderstands what's being asked, and sometimes it isn't right. So she ends up answering the wrong question.Therefore, one improvement could be to fully listen to a student's question before answering.The instruction was quite good. But having such long journals each week (and hearing other classes didn't put in asmuch work as our class) was quite disheartening.Instructions were unclear, assignment expectations and metrics were very unclearThe instruction in this course was goodThe Lectures Videos were interesting but the course content could be delivered in a more interesting way with moreexamples. The role play was a good example.I see why this course was taught the way it was. It's probably the best way for this course to be taught. But it's not thebest for me.

Although sometimes theirresponses weren\'t really helpful. One time I asked a clarification question about an assignment, and I got a responseessentially saying ""Why do you think we did that?"" It doesn\'t help clear up anything. And essentially that makes me haveto make an assumption about the assignment which could be completely wrong and therefore be graded poorly for it.Even if I were to use logic to determine the correct assumption based on the wording of the assignment, the wordingitself could be different from what the professor/TA meant to say. So I could again be graded poorly for it. I asked thequestion in the first place because I wanted a concrete answer such that there\'s no ambiguity. Some of their responsesdoesn\'t help in resolving the ambiguity.No/AThe professor and TAs were open to any questions that I hadAnswers to practise problems, not just the problems themselves.Both TA\'s were helpful on helping the presentationNonePEOPLE MGMT. & ORG.

Didn't learn much in this class, despite of the fact,professor told us we are going to have 60 short answers on final exam which we were not given any guidelines orpractices.The distribution of the marks for this course is extremely poor.Instruction was of poor quality as the professor did not adequately go over course material. The lecture sessions werenot conductive to my learning as they barely facilitated the course content. This is difficult as there is very little guidancefor the final exam. Furthermore, the professor showed favouritism towards some students, and was openly unfair toother students.8.

However, at times, this deterred the overall quality of instruction when core topics about labour unions,relationships between stakeholders in union environments, etc. could not be covered during class time. However, towards the endof the semester when we started working on the work integrated learning project, the quality of learning by doing was veryenjoyable.For starters,the final assignment was not about Industrial relations, it was about recruitment. Although, the project was interesting, itfelt frustrating to do a project that was not entirely related to the course. The coolest part about this course was the arbitration lecturewhere is was a grievance procedure. That was quite interesting. The class discussions were interesting too. But, I wish thebeginning of the course had a better start towards lecture based learning. It felt extremely boring and a lack of structure. Personallyspeaking from my learning style, I found having discussions THROUGHOUT the lecture was not as helpful to being able to retainthe knowledge. Instead simple questions to trigger into the next topic, or after the lecture about the material is provided we have adiscussion. To have a discussion while the lecture is going made it hard to pinpoint what were points she actually wanted us tolearn vs. what the students are saying and trying to understand if the discussion is a tangent away from the course material for theday or part of the course material. There lecture slides were from the ""supplementary"" textbook and not the first recommendedtextbook, which felt frustrating. The concept of not sure which textbook to read, especially when having only 1, was frustrating aswell. Additionally, the weekly assignments felt irritating with how extensive they were, but I also understand that it was part ofwanting to have deep discussions during class. Maybe bi\xe2\x80\x93weekly might be better to not irritate the students.As a person, she is a very nice and kind person who means well. For that I am grateful. But I believe there is a disconnect there inthe way she teaches and presents herself to students. It almost feels as though she lacks sensitivity to social situations and has alot of favouritism towards particular students, which feels intimating for other students to want to participate. Again, I don\'t mean to say all of this in a spiteful way, she does seem like a kind person who wants to teach and motivate students,but her intent is not being produced into the impact she is looking for.It feels weird to recommend this to a professor, but if she could receive some sort of training with how to better be able to translateher intent for the students into that same impact for students. I\'m sure I am not the only student who feels this way in this course. The other students are probably writing more angry coursereviews.But overall, the course felt frustrating for the most part, but I cannot deny that I learned through the class lectures and weeklyassignments, and group arbitration case. Additionally, even though the final group project was not related to industrial relations, itwas interesting to learn about Women in STEM and Leadership.I hope professor could provide more information on course materials rather than group discussion because the materials in thiscourse is quite hard to understandProf really cares for her students. Prof really wanted students to understand concepts and relate it to real life situations.Prof made great efforts to help students do well esp with the Covid situation.In\xe2\x80\x93class discussions were very interesting (although sometimes went off\xe2\x80\x93topic) and in\xe2\x80\x93class activities were also engaging andpractical (negotiation and arbitration). The tests were relevant to the course material but it wasn\'t really covered in class (because ofthe off\xe2\x80\x93topic discussions) and the project also did not seem to relate to the course either.I think that the exams are too long, 44 MC is too much to do with the LA in that amount of time. I think the exam should be shortenedin terms of multiple choice. I also think the course project had little to do with industrial relations and seemed like more of arecruitment project. I would rather more interactive classes like the ones where we had debates and have higher participationmarks and maybe all long answer or long answer and only a few MC.

Students were left to teach themselves, and the professor was not helpful inclarifying concepts. The professor would spend max 10\xe2\x80\x9315 minutes on actually teaching the concepts and the rest on breakoutrooms. Rather than teaching the concepts, students were left to participate in breakout rooms for majority of the class, without clearinstructions from the professor. Furthermore, the class was extremely disorganized, majority of the time my classmates and I wereconfused on what to do for in class activities. As the professor barely explained and rushed explanations. I felt that I basically taughtthe entire course to myself. Overall, I honestly felt that I did not learn much, and the concepts I did learn were from my own learning.As when the professor did explain the lecture, the explanation was rushed and not clear. Furthermore, the TA did not provide anysupport. When asked about the in\xe2\x80\x93class activity one time, he had no idea what was going on. Only on a few occasions did weinteract with the TA. Thus, the TA did not provide any support whatsoever.it was good. the articles for real\xe2\x80\x93world connections helped demonstrate the course materialThe quality is so bad. Lecture is useless and term test is not asking the content of the textbook at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s like doing a reading andcomprehension exercise. Professor also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give any correct answers for the hw and see our answers even there are only 11students in the class.Not very clear for instructions.

It is a bit confusing. Why notjust using BB Collaborate?Have been with Dr. R for over 2 years now. She made the lectures very interesting so that i never looses interest in such materialI felt like I joined a cross\xe2\x80\x93continental coach bus where I did not know where I was going and somehow find an appropriatedestination. I wish there was far more cohesion and emphasis in what we are doing and why its important. Not a bad experiencebut not the best either, mostly because we had no clue what was going on but went along with whatever.Prof Radhakrishnan is not great at teaching. It is so ironic, that we discussed about the topic ""feedback"", but the prof never seem tochange her teaching style. Have you ever put yourself at the students position and listen to a recording of yourself teaching? Haveyou considered looking on the reviews on RateMyProf? because I can confirm that your teaching is an utter mess. You keep onasking so many questions in the lectures, are you actually teaching? or are you just making us students more confused? What isthe point of coming to lectures, if the objective of your teaching is to ask us questions that we don\'t know the answers to. Are theSTUDENTS teaching the class or are YOU teaching the class? I also do not see the purpose in coming to your office hours, youshould have already explained everything clearly in the lecture. Role plays and discussions are useless, that time could have beenbetter used by you teaching and explaining MORE, instead of asking students. I feel bad for the undergraduate students who has nochoice but to take courses with you. Also, I do not understand your obsession of having our faces on camera, pictures of our faces,not all of us prefer to have our faces critiqued, I can\'t even focus if I feel my face is being watched and recorded. Conclusion, thequality of instruction in this course our any course taught by Prof Radhakrishnan is really bad, no improvement from previous years.Greatly dissappointed, waste of money, waste of time, waste of my education.Engaging and quite applicable to real life.This course is a little dry as I don\'t have any interest in it but Professor Phani made the course more fun by implementing groupdiscussions and ""game\xe2\x80\x93like"" exercises with roleplaying scenarios with others in the class even in a remote setting.8.

i also do not see the purpose in coming to your office hours , youshould have already explained everything clearly in the lecture . role plays and discussions are useless , that time could have beenbetter used by you teaching and explaining more , instead of asking students . i feel bad for the undergraduate students who has nochoice but to take courses with you . also , i do not understand your obsession of having our faces on camera , pictures of our faces , ot all of us prefer to have our faces critiqued , i can\' t even focus if i feel my face is being watched and recorded . conclusion , thequality of instruction in this course our any course taught by prof radhakrishnan is really bad , (no) not improvement from previous years . greatly dissappointed , waste of money , waste of time , waste of my education . engaging and quite applicable to real life . this course is a xlittle dry as i don\' t have any interest in it but professor phani made the course more fun by implementing groupdiscussions and "" game\xe2\x80\x93like "" exercises with roleplaying scenarios with others in the class even in a remote setting . 8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course . comments '",0.0748898678414097,0.0837004405286344,0.0748898678414097,0.0220264317180617,0.0572687224669604,0.149779735682819,0.0881057268722467,0.0176211453744493,0.066079295154185,0.026431718061674,0.0616740088105727,0.0220264317180617,0.052863436123348,0.0881057268722467,0.0748898678414097,0.00440528634361234,0.00440528634361234,0.00440528634361234,0.013215859030837,0.052863436123348,0.0484581497797357,0.052863436123348,0.0176211453744493,0.0308370044052863,0.092511013215859,0.0616740088105727,0.00881057268722467,0,0.0308370044052863,0.0440528634361234,0.013215859030837,0,0,0.013215859030837,0.00440528634361234,0.00440528634361234,0.052863436123348,0.00881057268722467,0,0.00440528634361234,0.0572687224669604,0.00881057268722467,0,0.0220264317180617,0,0.00881057268722467,0.013215859030837,0.0308370044052863,0.0176211453744493,0.00440528634361234,0.0220264317180617,0.0440528634361234,0.0220264317180617,0.00881057268722467,0.0220264317180617,0.00440528634361234,0.00881057268722467,0.00440528634361234,0,0,0.0352422907488987,0,0.026431718061674,0,0.052863436123348,0.026431718061674,0.0176211453744493,0.013215859030837,0.0837004405286344,0.013215859030837,0.00440528634361234,0.0572687224669604,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.0616740088105727,-0.026431718061674,0.052863436123348,0.0220264317180617,0.0484581497797357,0.0308370044052863,0.066079295154185,0.00440528634361234,-0.0176211453744493,0.00440528634361234,0.00440528634361233,0.039647577092511,0.0176211453744493,0.0352422907488987,0.013215859030837,0.00881057268722467,0.0484581497797357,0.039647577092511,0,-0.0220264317180617,0.026431718061674,0.0352422907488987,0.00881057268722467,0,0,-0.0220264317180617,0.00440528634361234,0,"Leadership Skills","LEC02",3,2.9,"3.4",3,"3.2",3,"3","3.5",3.2,462,44.47,65.57,55.12,28.93,23.1,23.59,86.36,3.9,3.03,0.43,0.43,17.1,1.52,15.58,4.76,2.38,1.08,3.68,1.08,4.11,0,3.68,2.16,1.52,1.52,0.43,1.08,0,0,0,0,14.72,6.71,1.3,0.87,0,0.22,1.95,8.66,0,0.43,0,0.22,7.36,0.65,0,6.71,0,0.87,0,0,0,0,0,0.22,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,6.28,8.23,0.87,1.52,4.76,0.65,0.22,0.87,2.16,4.33,4.76,0.65,0.43,0.43,0,"Management"

Starting from our course schedule, Dr.R made a detailed andorganized schedule that showed us each topic, homework, reading that is covered for that week. This allowed us to always prepareahead of time. During class, Dr.R always tried to keep the class engaged with breakout rooms. She cared about her studentssuccess and well being!There are good things and bad things. I would like to start off by saying i liked the way the professor teaches and explain conceptsfor compensation. They made sense and felt like i could follow along. Her group project did deepen my knowledge in the concept ofcompensation. Although, it was an immense amount of work, and along other courses during the semester, this is too much tohandle and stressful given it is so close to exam season. The questions for the group project can be vague and leave peoplefeeling confused but she does assist with allowing and encouraging setting up meetings with her. I think her teachings of thecourse material and her group project were what I liked most. Despite the amount of intense work, it was interesting and I liked theflexibility to explore ideas and explain them than to be tested on them. The exam was very confusing. The questions mention topics discussed in class, but the way they were phrased were very vagueand you could not properly understand what it was asking from you that she expected. Additionally, to make things worse, questionswere weighted 3, 7 or 8 marks each. That was very confusing because the question would ask for something really big that requiresa lot of explaining, but was worth only 3 points. so would that mean 3 sentences? it was really hard to understand what she wantedfrom us which made the exam very frustrating. If i can suggest, i would recommend making the exams out of 100 for better cognitiveunderstanding for those students as that is what they are used to. Additionally, the extra material to be read during the exam washorrifying to make things worse. The additional reading required during an exam made things immensely overwhelming and feltlike there was not enough time. I was not fond of her exam. I am sorry, but that is simply my own opinion. Her quiz questions were also quite confusing, was also not a fan of those. Only the last quiz seemed reasonable. The weekly homeworks were both good and bad. It was bad to have so much due during the week every week during the first half ofthe course, but I honestly believe part of the experience in solidifying that knowledge during this course is dependent on thoseweekly homeworks. I hate them, but I would not remove them as it was a crucial part in developing my understanding andsolidifying my knowledge for this course.Overall, she is a very kind professor with great intentions for her student's development and learning. The group project andhomeworks are appreciated to say in the most positive way. But the exam was such a mess, and the quiz was alright i guess. Theexam was horrifying and 10/10 would not recommend (sorry :( ) but i hope she finds a way to enhance her exams to have better directed questions for her students' understanding.I understand now why she says why harsh professors who are effective in getting learning across are evaluated moreharshly/negatively. Her homeworks and group project were so much work to complete, but effective in getting the learning across.Shes a great professor, but please, for the sake of future students, please fix the exam questions to be less vague, less additionalreadings, and a better weighting?She has also inspired me to consider continue learning stats. :)professor radakrishnan did a very good job explaining the concepts. I feel however that there was so much readings from thetextbook that it was not possible to go over every concept in class. There was a lot of self\xe2\x80\x93learning to be successful via the textbookbut the course instruction was stimulating, engaging, and good.I liked that the quizzes were spread out throughout the semester because it allowed us to study less content for each one. I think thelast quiz should be earlier on though because it was on six chapters. I like the homework because it allows us to apply what welearned. I think that the lecture slides should be cut down though because it is a lot and we do not usually get through them all inclass. For the online exam I think that one article was 27 pages long which had me confused on whether I was supposed to readthat all during the exam. I would recommend only including the important pages not the whole document. I did not feel prepared forthe group project. I was confused on how to conduct the regression and Wharton does not provide a detailed overview on how theygather their data which the professor wanted us to talk about in the project. I think the project would be better if she maybe providedeach group with a dataset and background on the dataset since that information is not provided in Wharton. Questions 3,4,5 arealso very similar in the group project so maybe also more clearly define the differences between each one. Also, I felt that we mostlylearned about job analysis and job evaluation in depth which I liked but we did not cover chapters 2,3,10, and 11 as much.8.

Starting from our course schedule, Dr.R made a detailed andorganized schedule that showed us each topic, homework, reading that is covered for that week. This allowed us to always prepareahead of time. During class, Dr.R always tried to keep the class engaged with breakout rooms. She cared about her studentssuccess and well being!There are good things and bad things. I would like to start off by saying i liked the way the professor teaches and explain conceptsfor compensation. They made sense and felt like i could follow along. Her group project did deepen my knowledge in the concept ofcompensation. Although, it was an immense amount of work, and along other courses during the semester, this is too much tohandle and stressful given it is so close to exam season. The questions for the group project can be vague and leave peoplefeeling confused but she does assist with allowing and encouraging setting up meetings with her. I think her teachings of thecourse material and her group project were what I liked most. Despite the amount of intense work, it was interesting and I liked theflexibility to explore ideas and explain them than to be tested on them. The exam was very confusing. The questions mention topics discussed in class, but the way they were phrased were very vagueand you could not properly understand what it was asking from you that she expected. Additionally, to make things worse, questionswere weighted 3, 7 or 8 marks each. That was very confusing because the question would ask for something really big that requiresa lot of explaining, but was worth only 3 points. so would that mean 3 sentences? it was really hard to understand what she wantedfrom us which made the exam very frustrating. If i can suggest, i would recommend making the exams out of 100 for better cognitiveunderstanding for those students as that is what they are used to. Additionally, the extra material to be read during the exam washorrifying to make things worse. The additional reading required during an exam made things immensely overwhelming and feltlike there was not enough time. I was not fond of her exam. I am sorry, but that is simply my own opinion. Her quiz questions were also quite confusing, was also not a fan of those. Only the last quiz seemed reasonable. The weekly homeworks were both good and bad. It was bad to have so much due during the week every week during the first half ofthe course, but I honestly believe part of the experience in solidifying that knowledge during this course is dependent on thoseweekly homeworks. I hate them, but I would not remove them as it was a crucial part in developing my understanding andsolidifying my knowledge for this course.Overall, she is a very kind professor with great intentions for her student\'s development and learning. The group project andhomeworks are appreciated to say in the most positive way. But the exam was such a mess, and the quiz was alright i guess. Theexam was horrifying and 10/10 would not recommend (sorry :( ) but i hope she finds a way to enhance her exams to have better directed questions for her students\' understanding.I understand now why she says why harsh professors who are effective in getting learning across are evaluated moreharshly/negatively. Her homeworks and group project were so much work to complete, but effective in getting the learning across.Shes a great professor, but please, for the sake of future students, please fix the exam questions to be less vague, less additionalreadings, and a better weighting?She has also inspired me to consider continue learning stats. :)professor radakrishnan did a very good job explaining the concepts. I feel however that there was so much readings from thetextbook that it was not possible to go over every concept in class. There was a lot of self\\xe2\\x80\\x93learning to be successful via the textbookbut the course instruction was stimulating, engaging, and good.I liked that the quizzes were spread out throughout the semester because it allowed us to study less content for each one. I think thelast quiz should be earlier on though because it was on six chapters. I like the homework because it allows us to apply what welearned. I think that the lecture slides should be cut down though because it is a lot and we do not usually get through them all inclass. For the online exam I think that one article was 27 pages long which had me confused on whether I was supposed to readthat all during the exam. I would recommend only including the important pages not the whole document. I did not feel prepared forthe group project. I was confused on how to conduct the regression and Wharton does not provide a detailed overview on how theygather their data which the professor wanted us to talk about in the project. I think the project would be better if she maybe providedeach group with a dataset and background on the dataset since that information is not provided in Wharton. Questions 3,4,5 arealso very similar in the group project so maybe also more clearly define the differences between each one. Also, I felt that we mostlylearned about job analysis and job evaluation in depth which I liked but we did not cover chapters 2,3,10, and 11 as much.8.

she has also inspired me to consider continue learning stats . : ) professor radakrishnan did a very good job explaining the concepts . i feel however that there was so much readings from thetextbook that it was not possible to go over every concept in class . there was a lot of self\\xe2\\x80\\x93learning to be successful via the textbookbut the course instruction was stimulating , engaging , and good . i liked that the quizzes were spread out throughout the semester because it allowed us to study (less) not content for each one . i think thelast quiz should be earlier on though because it was on six chapters . i like the homework because it allows us to apply what welearned . i think that the lecture slides should be cut down though because it is a lot and we do not usually get through them all inclass . for the online exam i think that one article was 27 pages long which had me confused on whether i was supposed to readthat all during the exam . i would recommend only including the important pages not whole document . i did not prepared forthe group project . i was confused on how to conduct the regression and wharton does not provide a detailed overview on how theygather their data which the professor wanted us to talk about in the project . i think the project would be better if she maybe providedeach group with a dataset and background on the dataset since that information is not provided in wharton . questions 3 , 4 , 5 arealso very similar in the group project so maybe also more clearly define the differences between each one . also , i felt that we mostlylearned about job analysis and job evaluation in depth which i liked but we did not cover chapters 2 , 3 , 10 , and 11 as much . 8 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course . comments "" '",0.0750551876379691,0.0816777041942605,0.139072847682119,0.0264900662251656,0.0507726269315673,0.141280353200883,0.163355408388521,0.0264900662251656,0.0618101545253863,0.0485651214128035,0.125827814569536,0.0198675496688742,0.0353200883002208,0.101545253863135,0.143487858719647,0.0022075055187638,0,0.00441501103752759,0.0022075055187638,0.0596026490066225,0.0529801324503311,0.101545253863135,0.0176600441501104,0.0353200883002208,0.103752759381898,0.116997792494481,0.00662251655629139,0.0022075055187638,0.0551876379690949,0.0507726269315673,0.00883002207505519,0,0,0.011037527593819,0,0.0132450331125828,0.0309050772626932,0.0132450331125828,0.00441501103752759,0.0154525386313466,0.0375275938189845,0.0176600441501104,0.00441501103752759,0.00441501103752759,0,0.00662251655629139,0.0176600441501104,0.0264900662251656,0.0264900662251656,0.00662251655629139,0.00883002207505519,0.0375275938189845,0.033112582781457,0.0198675496688742,0.00441501103752759,0.0132450331125828,0.0397350993377483,0,0,0,0.0154525386313466,0.00883002207505519,0.00883002207505519,0,0.0905077262693157,0.0154525386313466,0.00883002207505519,0.0132450331125828,0.0949227373068433,0.0176600441501104,0.00441501103752759,0.0309050772626932,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.0485651214128035,0.0176600441501104,0.112582781456954,0.0154525386313466,0.0198675496688742,0.0640176600441501,0.125827814569536,-0.0022075055187638,-0.00441501103752759,0.00441501103752759,-0.00441501103752759,0.0419426048565121,0.0264900662251656,0.0750551876379691,0.011037527593819,0.0264900662251656,0.0662251655629139,0.0838852097130243,-0.0132450331125828,-0.0022075055187638,0.0419426048565121,0.011037527593819,0.00883002207505519,0,0,-0.00441501103752759,-0.00883002207505519,0,"Compensation","LEC01",1.5,1.5,"1.5",1.5,"1.5",1,"1","4",1,1020,46.41,42.94,39.59,46.94,20,23.63,90.1,3.63,2.06,1.18,0.49,18.24,1.08,17.16,5.78,2.75,1.96,3.33,0.49,4.41,0,6.67,4.22,2.45,2.84,1.37,1.47,0.29,0.2,0.1,0,13.73,6.08,2.16,0.59,0,0,2.16,8.04,0,2.55,0,0.29,7.16,0,0.59,6.86,0.2,0.2,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.39,0.2,0.39,0.2,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.29,4.02,4.71,0,0.29,3.82,0.1,0,0.59,3.33,6.57,2.84,0.69,0.29,0.2,0.1,"Management"

However, I did not find the powerpointsuseful because there is always a lot of information on the slides and that is not properly organized as evidenced by the largenumber of slides per class (40\xe2\x80\x9360 slides). She does add some statistics and graphs which slightly improves our learning.Teaching Style: she doesn't do a lot of teaching because she mostly reads off her notes on the powerpoint slides, which makes itdifficult for us to stay focused because speaks pretty fast and rarely stops. I found it more useful to read the textbook on my own, butI found it unfair that she expected us to read sometimes 2\xe2\x80\x933 chapters per week given that they were on average 30\xe2\x80\x9350 pages. Forexample: the final exam was only two weeks apart from the midterm, but she expected us to read 2\xe2\x80\x933 chapters 1 week, and 2\xe2\x80\x933chapters the next week.I did not learn anything valuable from this course. The instructions of course work were often unclear and vague. Overall, I did nothave a good experience with this course and the corresponding professor.The course about recruitment and selection was interesting. The material about reliability and validity were very challenging to learn,but was a interesting concept. But, I wish the beginning of the course had a better start towards lecture based learning. It felt extremely boring and a lack ofstructure. Personally speaking from my learning style, I found having discussions THROUGHOUT the lecture was not as helpful tobeing able to retain the knowledge. Instead simple questions to trigger into the next topic, or after the lecture about the material isprovided we have a discussion. To have a discussion while the lecture is going made it hard to pinpoint what were points sheactually wanted us to learn vs. what the students are saying and trying to understand if the discussion is a tangent away from thecourse material for the day or part of the course material. No complaints against lectures that were purely discussion basedthough. Its just for the ones where discussion with lecture/chapter material.As a person, she is a very nice and kind person who means well. For that I am grateful. But I believe there is a disconnect there inthe way she teaches and presents herself to students. It almost feels as though she lacks sensitivity to social situations and has alot of favouritism towards particular students, which feels intimating for other students to want to participate. Again, I don't mean to say all of this in a spiteful way, she does seem like a kind person who wants to teach and motivate students,but her intent is not being translated into the impact she is looking for.It feels weird to recommend this to a professor, but if she could receive some sort of training with how to better be able to translateher intent for the students into that same impact for students.But overall, I entered this course with high expectations to learn about recruitment and selection but it was not a very structuredcourse for me to follow, but i do understand this may be a result of my learning style as some may prefer this more free\xe2\x80\x93flowing anddiscussion based lecture style.The professor is so so so bad, the final report's instruction is very unclear.The exams and assignments were relevant to the course. The homework was sometimes a lot of work to do in one week. The labsessions did not seem to relate to any of the assessments (exams or assignments). The assignment had a lot of requirements forthe constraints provided (professor/course requirements and employer requirements) fit into 8\xe2\x80\x93page written report and 15\xe2\x80\x93minutepresentation.Extremely long exams with not enough time to completeExtremely long lectures that are not helpful at allShe does not explain concepts clearly, does not answer questions clearlyShe seems like she is not familiar with the topics of the courseWasted classroom time on a program that we did not have any access to outside of one specific classroom, thus we could notpractice was learned. Additionally, he was not familiar with the program either.She rushed through explanations.Just an overall very low teaching quality.HR Recruitment and Selection MGHD25H3-S-LEC01-Phanikiran Radhakrishnan-4/3/2020 4/168.

(no) not complaints against lectures that were purely discussion basedthough . its just for the ones where discussion with lecture/chapter material . as a person , she is a very nice and kind person who means well . for that i am grateful . but i believe there is a disconnect there inthe way she teaches and presents herself to students . it almost feels as though she lack xsensitivity to social situations and has alot of favouritism towards particular students , which feels intimating for other students to want to participate . again , i do not mean to say all of this in a spiteful way , she does seem xlike a kind person who wants to teach and motivate students , ut her intent is not translated into the impact she is looking for . it feels weird to recommend this to a professor , but if she could receive some sort of training with how to better be able to translateher intent for the students into that same impact for students . but overall , i entered this course with high expectations to learn about recruitment and selection but it was not structuredcourse for me to follow , but i do understand this may be a result of my learning style as some may prefer this more free\xe2\x80\x93flowing anddiscussion based lecture style . the professor is so so so bad , the final report ' s instruction is very unclear . the exams and assignments were relevant to the course . the homework was sometimes a lot of work to do in one week . the labsessions did not relate to any of the assessments ( exams or assignments ) . the assignment had a lot of requirements forthe constraints provided ( professor/course requirements and employer requirements ) fit into 8\xe2\x80\x93page written report and 15\xe2\x80\x93minutepresentation . extremely long exams with not enough time to completeextremely long lectures that are not helpful at allshe does not explain concepts clearly , does not answer questions clearlyshe seem xlike she is not familiar with the topics of the coursewasted classroom time on a program that we did not access to outside of one specific classroom , thus we could notpractice was learned . additionally , he was not familiar with the program either . she rushed through explanations . just an overall very (low) not teaching quality . hr recruitment and selection mghd25h3 - s - lec01 - phanikiran radhakrishnan - 4/3/2020 4/168 . please comment on any assistance that was available to support your learning in this course . comments """,0.0538461538461538,0.0666666666666667,0.0974358974358974,0.0282051282051282,0.0307692307692308,0.107692307692308,0.123076923076923,0.0230769230769231,0.0435897435897436,0.0487179487179487,0.0820512820512821,0.0230769230769231,0.0153846153846154,0.0794871794871795,0.102564102564103,0.0153846153846154,0.00256410256410256,0.00256410256410256,0.0102564102564103,0.0461538461538462,0.0435897435897436,0.0769230769230769,0.0230769230769231,0.0256410256410256,0.0769230769230769,0.0974358974358974,0.0179487179487179,0.00256410256410256,0.0282051282051282,0.0282051282051282,0.0179487179487179,0,0,0.0102564102564103,0.00256410256410256,0.00769230769230769,0.0179487179487179,0.00769230769230769,0.00256410256410256,0.0128205128205128,0.0256410256410256,0.0102564102564103,0,0,0,0.0153846153846154,0.00512820512820513,0.0128205128205128,0.0102564102564103,0.00512820512820513,0.00256410256410256,0.0179487179487179,0.0153846153846154,0.00512820512820513,0,0,0.0128205128205128,0.00512820512820513,0,0,0.0102564102564103,0.0102564102564103,0.00256410256410256,0,0.0461538461538462,0.0333333333333333,0.0179487179487179,0.0128205128205128,0.0564102564102564,0.0179487179487179,0.00256410256410256,0.0358974358974359,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.0358974358974359,0.0307692307692308,0.0743589743589744,0.0205128205128205,0.00256410256410257,0.0538461538461538,0.0923076923076923,0.0153846153846154,0.00256410256410256,0.00256410256410256,-0.00512820512820513,0.041025641025641,0.0307692307692308,0.0666666666666667,0.017948717948718,0.0230769230769231,0.058974358974359,0.0820512820512821,0.0128205128205128,0.00256410256410256,0.0282051282051282,0.0153846153846154,0.0128205128205128,0,0,0,-0.00769230769230769,0,"MGHC23H3","LEC01",2.6,2.8,"2.4",2.9,"2.6",2.3,"2.6","3.9",2.3,872,69.11,34.19,31.61,55.98,31.14,25.34,89.79,3.21,1.72,1.15,0.34,18.23,0.92,17.09,5.5,2.06,1.26,3.44,0.69,5.28,0,3.21,2.75,0.46,0.69,0.34,0.34,0,0.11,0,0,14.33,7.34,1.03,0.69,0.11,0.23,2.52,6.88,0,2.75,0,0.34,7.22,0,0.11,7.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.8,0.46,0.11,0.8,0.11,0.11,0,0,0.92,3.67,4.7,0.46,0.34,3.21,0.23,0,0.57,3.56,4.93,5.16,0.92,0.23,0.23,0,"Management"

As for thecourse material, I really enjoyed being able to discuss with my classmates and learning through conversation and the professor'ssummary at the end of class + the reflection journals as opposed to just reading articles or textbooks. In the future, I think having amore clear outline of what concepts we should have a good grasp of and what the final exam will be like would be helpful to thesuccess of those taking the class. But overall, I really appreciate Professor Radhakrishnan's efforts for this course \xe2\x80\x93 which was veryevident!I enjoyed the class discussion and cases we covered in the course since it gave me new perspectivesProfessor Radhakrishnan managed to make this course very interactive and interesting. She taught concepts through activities thatwere very eye\xe2\x80\x93opening and engaging. She clearly explained concepts and connected the activities to concepts.The prof relied on case studies and in class exercises for the majority of the course work on top of the readings. All of these weregreat because these exercises and cases really challenged our understanding of the class concepts through detailed discussionsand debates.The final group project was also really helpful in helping us further apply the course concepts to a real world problem: Tacklingvaccine hesitancy8.

Very little of the actual information required forunderstanding was taught within the class and the information that was provided was skimmed over rather quickly. Students wereleft to learn the slide materials on their own time and were given supplementary videos to watch out of class when there was anample amount of class time to cover all the material.The assignments (individual and group) instructions were not clear. It is hard for me to understand how to do well on theassignmentsIt is really confusing and the instruction was not clear at allLimited teaching, would make the classes revolve around group work with limited to no guidance. Activities often felt pointless.The learning experience was great especially with the in class exercises and discussions! The ability to talk to the professor and TAover teams was also an excellent addition that I have not experienced in other classes as it made it easy to ask questions and seethe questions other students have asked. The only dislike I had was the way in which the class materials were organized. It wasunclear to me which slides we were supposed to look at for class as there was just so much material given that are similar yethave different slides included. Additionally, finding the journal questions required more effort than needed.

Some sections werevague and asked questions that were difficult to obtain information on.Not great. Professor is too unfocused, does not relate assessments and homework to course material.Not enough instruction in lectures. Pre\xe2\x80\x93recorded lectures provided were not helpful.8.

She makes learning super easy, doesn't complicate things. Slides are detailed which is very muchneeded in a university environment and really aids our learning overall.I did not like Professor Rs style of teaching. She did not explain concepts well which is fine because we can learn it ourselves butshe did also did not explain assignments well at all. She has weekly journals due after class and is very confusing as to what weneed to answer in those journals. Nobody really knows what is going on in this class half the time as she is all over the place. Weuse multiple programs at once (Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Idecision games) so it is very overwhelming. She also posts1921001921 different links for each class and multiple powerpoints dating back to 2017. Overall, I'm not sure if I learned anything inthis class.The material and lectures were interesting. I recommend not using I decision because a lot of people had issues. however, thebreakout rooms on Zoom were very helpful.i really enjoyed DR.R's class, the materials are interesting and the way she delivers them is also really fun.The course session and instruction are very ambiguous and cause so many confusion. The content layout are very messy. The in\xe2\x80\x93class engagement is very poor due to those ambiguous and every student has no idea what is going 80% of the time. pretty muchthe class environment is very discouraging for learning due to all confusions Not instructive for the lectures. Everything learned are from self\xe2\x80\x93reading o journals. Up to now, I have no idea what is expected to geta good mark or what is expect to be in exam and how are we going to elaborate in exam.........The IDG is a really cool experience that allow us to work with peers while having online lectures.However, the time zone issue can be a problem for some students. For example, I will have to wake up at 2am to attend the class,so maybe having some alternative will be great. However, I do enjoy the class participation and discussion and class activity.With all the roleplays and simulations I was able to understand how to apply the concepts we learned in lectureWay too many platforms being used in this course. idecisiongames was not necessary\xe2\x80\x93 it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work 75% of the time. Prof is very enthusiastic and creates interesting lectures :)Fun class. GoodThere is a lot of work before and after the lecture.The quality of instruction in this course was great and I really enjoyed the different way of learning. I enjoyed the role\xe2\x80\x93play activitiesand the group project as they allowed us to think outside the box and try something different from previous courses.The multiple online platforms used makes my learning experience not very good. Too many apps make it hard to get discussionpartners.8.

I liked how he came to class eachweek as well so we could ask him questions directly.TA and Professori feel like i could always reach out to her when i have a problem.I decision game is not a good pick. Instruction should be clear enoughN/AGood, many office hours.The professor provided students with tons of assistance and also the TA Joe was really helpful for the most part.
